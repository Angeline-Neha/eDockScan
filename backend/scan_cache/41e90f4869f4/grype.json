The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45337","epss":0.61257,"percentile":0.98283,"date":"2025-11-20"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.14.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v778-237x-gjrc","versionConstraint":"<0.31.0

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

When a HTTP request is processed by Traefik, certain HTTP headers such as X-Forwarded-Host or X-Forwarded-Port are added by Traefik before the request is routed to the application. For a HTTP client, it should not be possible to remove or modify these headers. Since the application trusts the value of these headers, security implications might arise, if they can be modified. For HTTP/1.1, however, it was found that some of theses custom headers can indeed be removed and in certain cases manipulated. The attack relies on the HTTP/1.1 behavior, that headers can be defined as hop-by-hop via the HTTP Connection header. This issue has been addressed in release versions 2.11.9 and 3.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade.

A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.\n\nUsing a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.\n\nA security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.\n\nDocker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.\n\ndocker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.03, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches. If one is unable to upgrade immediately, avoid using AuthZ plugins and/or restrict access to the Docker API to trusted parties, following the principle of least privilege.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.9,"exploitabilityScore":3.2,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-41110","epss":0.05314,"percentile":0.89037,"date":"2025-11-20"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-41110","cwe":"CWE-187","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-41110","cwe":"CWE-444","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-41110","cwe":"CWE-863","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.21+incompatible"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v23v-6jw2-98fq","versionConstraint":">=19.03.0,<23.0.15 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"23.0.15"}}],"artifact":{"id":"3a28e4e31e56eced","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.21+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/traefik","layerID":"sha256:a8b401af8869167bdbc4f6fd8cd82f802f96edb5f3ef35c36cc69fb8943243a4","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/traefik","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v20.10.21\\+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v20.10.21%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.5","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:UTLdBmHk3bEY+w8qeO5KttOhy6OmXWsl/FEet9Uswog=","mainModule":"github.com/traefik/traefik/v2"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-5535","dataSource":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2024-5535","namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.18","severity":"Critical","urls":[],"cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","epss":0.04618,"percentile":0.8819,"date":"2025-11-20"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.1.6-r0"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.1.6-r0","date":"2024-06-30","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":4.17929},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-5535","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5535","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4ada436a1946cbb24db5ab4ca082b69c1bc10f37","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/99fb785a5f85315b95288921a321a935ea29a51e","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/cf6f91f6121f4db167405db2f0de410a456f260c","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e86ac436f0bd54d4517745483e2315650fae7b2c","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/9947251413065a05189a63c9b7a6c1d4e224c21c","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/b78ec0824da857223486660177d3b1f255c65d87","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240627.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/27/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/28/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/08/15/1","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/10/msg00033.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00000.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240712-0005/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241025-0006/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241025-0010/"],"description":"Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an\nempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to\nbe sent to the peer.\n\nImpact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences\nsuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash.

The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby, is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in dockerd and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code.\n\nThe overlay network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the u32 iptables extension provided by the xt_u32 kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nTwo iptables rules serve to filter incoming VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted network and discards unencrypted datagrams. The rules are appended to the end of the INPUT filter chain, following any rules that have been previously set by the system administrator. Administrator-set rules take precedence over the rules Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams, which can potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been discarded.\n\nThe injection of arbitrary Ethernet frames can enable a Denial of Service attack. A sophisticated attacker may be able to establish a UDP or TCP connection by way of the container’s outbound gateway that would otherwise be blocked by a stateful firewall, or carry out other escalations beyond simple injection by smuggling packets into the overlay network.\n\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3 and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Close the VXLAN port (by default, UDP port 4789) to incoming traffic at the Internet boundary to prevent all VXLAN packet injection, and/or ensure that the `xt_u32` kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.7,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28840","epss":0.02087,"percentile":0.82601,"date":"2025-11-20"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28840","cwe":"CWE-420","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28840","cwe":"CWE-636","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28840","cwe":"CWE-203","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28840","cwe":"CWE-755","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.21+incompatible"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-232p-vwff-86mp","versionConstraint":">=1.12.0,<20.10.24 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"20.10.24"}}],"artifact":{"id":"3a28e4e31e56eced","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.21+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/traefik","layerID":"sha256:a8b401af8869167bdbc4f6fd8cd82f802f96edb5f3ef35c36cc69fb8943243a4","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/traefik","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v20.10.21\\+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v20.10.21%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.5","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:UTLdBmHk3bEY+w8qeO5KttOhy6OmXWsl/FEet9Uswog=","mainModule":"github.com/traefik/traefik/v2"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-24784","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24784","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/555596","https://go.dev/issue/65083","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2609","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0007/"],"description":"The ParseAddressList function incorrectly handles comments (text within parentheses) within display names.

is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. An off-path attacker can inject an ICMP Packet Too Large packet. Since affected quic-go versions used IP_PMTUDISC_DO, the kernel would then return a \"message too large\" error on sendmsg, i.e. when quic-go attempts to send a packet that exceeds the MTU claimed in that ICMP packet. By setting this value to smaller than 1200 bytes (the minimum MTU for QUIC), the attacker can disrupt a QUIC connection. Crucially, this can be done after completion of the handshake, thereby circumventing any TCP fallback that might be implemented on the application layer (for example, many browsers fall back to HTTP over TCP if they're unable to establish a QUIC connection).

The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in `dockerd` and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code.\n\nThe `overlay` network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with the VXLAN metadata, including a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the `u32` iptables extension provided by the `xt_u32` kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nAn iptables rule designates outgoing VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted overlay network for IPsec encapsulation.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks on affected platforms silently transmit unencrypted data. As a result, `overlay` networks may appear to be functional, passing traffic as expected, but without any of the expected confidentiality or data integrity guarantees.\n\nIt is possible for an attacker sitting in a trusted position on the network to read all of the application traffic that is moving across the overlay network, resulting in unexpected secrets or user data disclosure. Thus, because many database protocols, internal APIs, etc. are not protected by a second layer of encryption, a user may use Swarm encrypted overlay networks to provide confidentiality, which due to this vulnerability this is no longer guaranteed.\n\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3, and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Close the VXLAN port (by default, UDP port 4789) to outgoing traffic at the Internet boundary in order to prevent unintentionally leaking unencrypted traffic over the Internet, and/or ensure that the `xt_u32` kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28841","epss":0.00506,"percentile":0.63651,"date":"2025-11-20"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28841","cwe":"CWE-311","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28841","cwe":"CWE-636","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28841","cwe":"CWE-311","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28841","cwe":"CWE-755","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.21+incompatible"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-33pg-m6jh-5237","versionConstraint":">=1.12.0,<20.10.24 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"20.10.24"}}],"artifact":{"id":"3a28e4e31e56eced","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.21+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/traefik","layerID":"sha256:a8b401af8869167bdbc4f6fd8cd82f802f96edb5f3ef35c36cc69fb8943243a4","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/traefik","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v20.10.21\\+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v20.10.21%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.5","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:UTLdBmHk3bEY+w8qeO5KttOhy6OmXWsl/FEet9Uswog=","mainModule":"github.com/traefik/traefik/v2"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-13176","dataSource":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2024-13176","namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.18","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.1,"exploitabilityScore":0.7,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-13176","epss":0.00546,"percentile":0.6521,"date":"2025-11-20"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-13176","cwe":"CWE-385","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.1.8-r0"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.1.8-r0","date":"2025-02-12","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.24842999999999996},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-13176","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-13176","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/07272b05b04836a762b4baa874958af51d513844","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/2af62e74fb59bc469506bc37eb2990ea408d9467","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/392dcb336405a0c94486aa6655057f59fd3a0902","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4b1cb94a734a7d4ec363ac0a215a25c181e11f65","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/77c608f4c8857e63e98e66444e2e761c9627916f","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/0d5fd1ab987f7571e2c955d8d8b638fc0fb54ded","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/a2639000db19878d5d89586ae7b725080592ae86","https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20250120.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/01/20/2","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/05/msg00028.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250124-0005/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250418-0010/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250502-0006/"],"description":"Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow recovering\nthe private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.\n\nImpact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations\ncould allow recovering the private key by an attacker.

A workaround involves adding a `PathRegexp` rule to the matcher to prevent matching a route with a `/../` in the path.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:P/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-32431","epss":0.00206,"percentile":0.38325,"date":"2025-11-20"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-32431","cwe":"CWE-22","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.11.24","2.11.24","3.3.6","3.3.6","3.3.6","3.4.0-rc2","3.4.0-rc2","3.4.0-rc2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"2.11.24","date":"2025-04-23","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"2.11.24","date":"2025-04-23","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"3.3.6","date":"2025-04-23","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"3.3.6","date":"2025-04-23","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"3.3.6","date":"2025-04-23","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"3.4.0-rc2","date":"2025-04-23","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"3.4.0-rc2","date":"2025-04-23","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"3.4.0-rc2","date":"2025-04-23","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.16789000000000004},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:traefik:traefik:2.10.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"traefik","version":"2.10.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-32431","versionConstraint":"< 2.11.24,< 2.11.24,>= 3.0, < 3.3.6,>= 3.0, < 3.3.6,>= 3.0, < 3.3.6,>= 3.4.0-rc1, < 3.4.0-rc2,>= 3.4.0-rc1, < 3.4.0-rc2,>= 3.4.0-rc1, < 3.4.0-rc2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:traefik:traefik:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.11.24"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ea62c7d06e881b44","name":"traefik","version":"2.10.7","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/traefik","layerID":"sha256:a8b401af8869167bdbc4f6fd8cd82f802f96edb5f3ef35c36cc69fb8943243a4","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/traefik","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:traefik:traefik:2.10.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/traefik@2.10.7","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-mq39-4gv4-mvpx","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mq39-4gv4-mvpx","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Moby's external DNS requests from 'internal' networks could lead to data exfiltration","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-29018","epss":0.00298,"percentile":0.50198,"date":"2025-11-20"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-29018","cwe":"CWE-669","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-29018","cwe":"CWE-669","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["23.0.11"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"23.0.11","date":"2024-03-21","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.16241},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-29018","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-29018","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/46609","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-mq39-4gv4-mvpx"],"description":"Moby is an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. Moby's networking implementation allows for many networks, each with their own IP address range and gateway, to be defined. This feature is frequently referred to as custom networks, as each network can have a different driver, set of parameters and thus behaviors. When creating a network, the `--internal` flag is used to designate a network as _internal_. The `internal` attribute in a docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_, and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.\n\nWhen containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique network interfaces and IP addresses. The host serves as a router for non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT to/from container IPs.\n\nContainers on an internal network may communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating with any networks the host has access to (LAN or WAN) as no default route is configured, and firewall rules are set up to drop all outgoing traffic. Communication with the gateway IP address (and thus appropriately configured host services) is possible, and the host may communicate with any container IP directly.\n\nIn addition to configuring the Linux kernel's various networking features to enable container networking, `dockerd` directly provides some services to container networks. Principal among these is serving as a resolver, enabling service discovery, and resolution of names from an upstream resolver.\n\nWhen a DNS request for a name that does not correspond to a container is received, the request is forwarded to the configured upstream resolver. This request is made from the container's network namespace: the level of access and routing of traffic is the same as if the request was made by the container itself.\n\nAs a consequence of this design, containers solely attached to an internal network will be unable to resolve names using the upstream resolver, as the container itself is unable to communicate with that nameserver. Only the names of containers also attached to the internal network are able to be resolved.\n\nMany systems run a local forwarding DNS resolver. As the host and any containers have separate loopback devices, a consequence of the design described above is that containers are unable to resolve names from the host's configured resolver, as they cannot reach these addresses on the host loopback device. To bridge this gap, and to allow containers to properly resolve names even when a local forwarding resolver is used on a loopback address, `dockerd` detects this scenario and instead forward DNS requests from the host namework namespace. The loopback resolver then forwards the requests to its configured upstream resolvers, as expected.\n\nBecause `dockerd` forwards DNS requests to the host loopback device, bypassing the container network namespace's normal routing semantics entirely, internal networks can unexpectedly forward DNS requests to an external nameserver. By registering a domain for which they control the authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will eventually be answered by their nameservers.\n\nDocker Desktop is not affected, as Docker Desktop always runs an internal resolver on a RFC 1918 address.\n\nMoby releases 26.0.0, 25.0.4, and 23.0.11 are patched to prevent forwarding any DNS requests from internal networks. As a workaround, run containers intended to be solely attached to internal networks with a custom upstream address, which will force all upstream DNS queries to be resolved from the container's network namespace.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-29018","epss":0.00298,"percentile":0.50198,"date":"2025-11-20"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-29018","cwe":"CWE-669","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-29018","cwe":"CWE-669","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.21+incompatible"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-mq39-4gv4-mvpx","versionConstraint":"<23.0.11 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"23.0.11"}}],"artifact":{"id":"3a28e4e31e56eced","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.21+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/traefik","layerID":"sha256:a8b401af8869167bdbc4f6fd8cd82f802f96edb5f3ef35c36cc69fb8943243a4","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/traefik","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v20.10.21\\+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v20.10.21%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.5","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:UTLdBmHk3bEY+w8qeO5KttOhy6OmXWsl/FEet9Uswog=","mainModule":"github.com/traefik/traefik/v2"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-6wrf-mxfj-pf5p","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6wrf-mxfj-pf5p","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Docker Swarm encrypted overlay network with a single endpoint is unauthenticated","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28842","epss":0.00257,"percentile":0.45782,"date":"2025-11-20"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28842","cwe":"CWE-420","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28842","cwe":"CWE-636","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28842","cwe":"CWE-755","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["20.10.24"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"20.10.24","date":"2023-04-05","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.15162999999999996},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-28842","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28842","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/moby/libnetwork/security/advisories/GHSA-gvm4-2qqg-m333","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-232p-vwff-86mp","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-33pg-m6jh-5237","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-6wrf-mxfj-pf5p","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/LYZOKMMVX4SIEHPJW3SJUQGMO5YZCPHC/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XNF4OLYZRQE75EB5TW5N42FSXHBXGWFE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZTE4ITXXPIWZEQ4HYQCB6N6GZIMWXDAI/"],"description":"Moby) is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in `dockerd` and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code.\n\nThe `overlay` network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with the VXLAN metadata, including a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the `u32` iptables extension provided by the `xt_u32` kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nThe `overlay` driver dynamically and lazily defines the kernel configuration for the VXLAN network on each node as containers are attached and detached. Routes and encryption parameters are only defined for destination nodes that participate in the network. The iptables rules that prevent encrypted overlay networks from accepting unencrypted packets are not created until a peer is available with which to communicate.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks silently accept cleartext VXLAN datagrams that are tagged with the VNI of an encrypted overlay network. As a result, it is possible to inject arbitrary Ethernet frames into the encrypted overlay network by encapsulating them in VXLAN datagrams. The implications of this can be quite dire, and GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw should be referenced for a deeper exploration.\n\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3, and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\nSome workarounds are available. In multi-node clusters, deploy a global ‘pause’ container for each encrypted overlay network, on every node. For a single-node cluster, do not use overlay networks of any sort. Bridge networks provide the same connectivity on a single node and have no multi-node features. The Swarm ingress feature is implemented using an overlay network, but can be disabled by publishing ports in `host` mode instead of `ingress` mode (allowing the use of an external load balancer), and removing the `ingress` network. If encrypted overlay networks are in exclusive use, block UDP port 4789 from traffic that has not been validated by IPSec.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28842","epss":0.00257,"percentile":0.45782,"date":"2025-11-20"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28842","cwe":"CWE-420","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28842","cwe":"CWE-636","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28842","cwe":"CWE-755","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.21+incompatible"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-6wrf-mxfj-pf5p","versionConstraint":">=1.12.0,<20.10.24 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"20.10.24"}}],"artifact":{"id":"3a28e4e31e56eced","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v20.10.21+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/traefik","layerID":"sha256:a8b401af8869167bdbc4f6fd8cd82f802f96edb5f3ef35c36cc69fb8943243a4","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/traefik","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v20.10.21\\+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v20.10.21%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.5","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:UTLdBmHk3bEY+w8qeO5KttOhy6OmXWsl/FEet9Uswog=","mainModule":"github.com/traefik/traefik/v2"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-24783","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24783","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/569339","https://go.dev/issue/65390","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2598","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0005/"],"description":"Verifying a certificate chain which contains a certificate with an unknown public key algorithm will cause Certificate.Verify to panic.

Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in \"dangerous\" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience). This fix is part of the 4.5.1 release. We are aware that this changes the behaviour of an established function and is not 100 % backwards compatible, so updating to 4.5.1 might break your code. In case you cannot update to 4.5.0, please make sure that you are properly checking for all errors (\"dangerous\" ones first), so that you are not running in the case detailed above.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-51744","epss":0.00198,"percentile":0.37442,"date":"2025-11-20"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-51744","cwe":"CWE-755","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v4","version":"v4.5.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-29wx-vh33-7x7r","versionConstraint":"<4.5.1

The code used strings.Split(token, \".\") to split JWT tokens, which is vulnerable to excessive memory consumption when processing maliciously crafted tokens with a large number of `.` characters.  An attacker could exploit this by sending numerous malformed tokens, leading to memory exhaustion and a Denial of Service. Version 4.0.5 fixes this issue. As a workaround, applications could pre-validate that payloads passed to Go JOSE do not contain an excessive number of `.` characters.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:U/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":6.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27144","epss":0.00068,"percentile":0.16756,"date":"2025-11-20"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27144","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/go-jose/go-jose/v3","version":"v3.0.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-c6gw-w398-hv78","versionConstraint":"<3.0.4 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.0.4"}}],"artifact":{"id":"05ee4457744af4b7","name":"github.com/go-jose/go-jose/v3","version":"v3.0.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/traefik","layerID":"sha256:a8b401af8869167bdbc4f6fd8cd82f802f96edb5f3ef35c36cc69fb8943243a4","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/traefik","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:go-jose:go-jose\\/v3:v3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:go-jose:go_jose\\/v3:v3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:go_jose:go-jose\\/v3:v3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:go_jose:go_jose\\/v3:v3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:go:go-jose\\/v3:v3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:go:go_jose\\/v3:v3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/go-jose/go-jose@v3.0.0#v3","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.5","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:s6rrhirfEP/CGIoc6p+PZAeogN2SxKav6Wp7+dyMWVo=","mainModule":"github.com/traefik/traefik/v2"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-22866","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22866","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/643735","https://go.dev/issue/71383","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/xU1ZCHUZw3k","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3447","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250221-0002/"],"description":"Due to the usage of a variable time instruction in the assembly implementation of an internal function, a small number of bits of secret scalars are leaked on the ppc64le architecture.

Encrypt client and ACME library written in Go (Lego). In versions 4.25.1 and below, the github.com/go-acme/lego/v4/acme/api package (thus the lego library and the lego cli as well) don't enforce HTTPS when talking to CAs as an ACME client. Unlike the http-01 challenge which solves an ACME challenge over unencrypted HTTP, the ACME protocol requires HTTPS when a client communicates with the CA to performs ACME functions. However, the library fails to enforce HTTPS both in the original discover URL (configured by the library user) and in the subsequent addresses returned by the CAs in the directory and order objects. If users input HTTP URLs or CAs misconfigure endpoints, protocol operations occur over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This compromises privacy by exposing request/response details like account and request identifiers to network attackers.

A firewalld vulnerability affects Moby releases before 28.0.0. When firewalld reloads, Docker fails to re-create iptables rules that isolate bridge networks, allowing any container to access all ports on any other container across different bridge networks on the same host. This breaks network segmentation between containers that should be isolated, creating significant risk in multi-tenant environments.
