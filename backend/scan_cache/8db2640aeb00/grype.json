do not properly consider backticks (`) as Javascript string delimiters, and do not escape them as expected. Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1, with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped. This should be used with caution.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24538","epss":0.23512,"percentile":0.95624,"date":"2025-11-20"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24538","cwe":"CWE-94","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-24538","cwe":"CWE-94","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.8","1.20.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.19.8","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.20.3","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":22.101280000000003},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-24538","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.8,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"856ae5282dfeec9e","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:c2ed65de3208d675ad7d6ab09492e482c911c4afac86a804b5c1e502f8dec2e6","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.18.2","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.2","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-41717","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41717","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/455635","https://go.dev/cl/455717","https://go.dev/issue/56350","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/L_3rmdT0BMU/m/yZDrXjIiBQAJ","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4BUK2ZIAGCULOOYDNH25JPU6JBES5NF2/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4SBIUECMLNC572P23DDOKJNKPJVX26SP/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/56B2FFESRYYP6IY2AZ3UWXLWKZ5IYZN4/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/5RSKA2II6QTD4YUKUNDVJQSRYSFC4VFR/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ANIOPUXWIHVRA6CEWXCGOMX3YYS6KFHG/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CHHITS4PUOZAKFIUBQAQZC7JWXMOYE4B/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CSVIS6MTMFVBA7JPMRAUNKUOYEVSJYSB/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KEOTKBUPZXHE3F352JBYNTSNRXYLWD6P/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NQGNAXK3YBPMUP3J4TECIRDHFGW37522/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PUM4DIVOLJCBK5ZDP4LJOL24GXT3YSIR/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PW3XC47AUW5J5M2ULJX7WCCL3B2ETLMT/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/Q52IQI754YAE4XPR4QBRWPIVZWYGZ4FS/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QBKBAZBIOXZV5QCFHZNSVXULR32XJCYD/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/REMHVVIBDNKSRKNOTV7EQSB7CYQWOUOU/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/T7N5GV4CHH6WAGX3GFMDD3COEOVCZ4RI/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/WPEIZ7AMEJCZXU3FEJZMVRNHQZXX5P3I/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZSVEMQV5ROY5YW5QE3I57HT3ITWG5GCV/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-1144","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230120-0008/"],"description":"An attacker can cause excessive memory growth in a Go server accepting HTTP/2 requests.

Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection.

This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected.

This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders=.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24536","epss":0.02915,"percentile":0.85135,"date":"2025-11-20"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24536","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-24536","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.8","1.20.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.19.8","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.20.3","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":2.18625},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-24536","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.8,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"856ae5282dfeec9e","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:c2ed65de3208d675ad7d6ab09492e482c911c4afac86a804b5c1e502f8dec2e6","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.18.2","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.2","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-24787","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24787","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/08/3","https://go.dev/cl/583815","https://go.dev/issue/67119","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/wkkO4P9stm0","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2825","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240531-0006/"],"description":"On Darwin, building a Go module which contains CGO can trigger arbitrary code execution when using the Apple version of ld, due to usage of the -lto_library flag in a \"#cgo LDFLAGS\" directive.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.4,"exploitabilityScore":0.5,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-24787","epss":0.03793,"percentile":0.8695,"date":"2025-11-20"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.21.10","1.22.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.21.10","date":"2024-05-14","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.22.3","date":"2024-05-14","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":2.16201},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-24787","versionConstraint":"< 1.21.10,>= 1.22.0-0, < 1.22.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.21.10"}}],"artifact":{"id":"856ae5282dfeec9e","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:c2ed65de3208d675ad7d6ab09492e482c911c4afac86a804b5c1e502f8dec2e6","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.18.2","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.2","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-56433","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-56433","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"shadow-utils (aka shadow) 4.4 through 4.17.0 establishes a default /etc/subuid behavior (e.g., uid 100000 through 165535 for the first user account) that can realistically conflict with the uids of users defined on locally administered networks, potentially leading to account takeover, e.g., by leveraging newuidmap for access to an NFS home directory (or same-host resources in the case of remote logins by these local network users).

With fix, header parsing now correctly allocates only the memory required to hold parsed headers.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24534","epss":0.01863,"percentile":0.81595,"date":"2025-11-20"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24534","cwe":"CWE-400","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-24534","cwe":"CWE-400","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.8","1.20.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.19.8","date":"2023-04-19","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.20.3","date":"2023-04-19","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":1.39725},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-24534","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.8,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"856ae5282dfeec9e","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:c2ed65de3208d675ad7d6ab09492e482c911c4afac86a804b5c1e502f8dec2e6","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.18.2","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.2","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-24784","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24784","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/555596","https://go.dev/issue/65083","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2609","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0007/"],"description":"The ParseAddressList function incorrectly handles comments (text within parentheses) within display names.

Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file.

A malicious HTTP client can further exploit this to cause a server to automatically read a large amount of data (up to about 1GiB) when a handler fails to read the entire body of a request. Chunk extensions are a little-used HTTP feature which permit including additional metadata in a request or response body sent using the chunked encoding.

Unix platforms, the Go runtime does not behave differently when a binary is run with the setuid/setgid bits. This can be dangerous in certain cases, such as when dumping memory state, or assuming the status of standard i/o file descriptors. If a setuid/setgid binary is executed with standard I/O file descriptors closed, opening any files can result in unexpected content being read or written with elevated privileges. Similarly, if a setuid/setgid program is terminated, either via panic or signal, it may leak the contents of its
