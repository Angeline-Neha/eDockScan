summary: Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS\nclients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory\naddress resulting in abnormal termination of the application process.\n\nImpact summary: Abnormal termination of an application can a cause a denial of\nservice.\n\nApplications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS clients checking\nserver certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address when\ncomparing the expected name with an `otherName` subject alternative name of an\nX.509 certificate. This may result in an exception that terminates the\napplication program.\n\nNote that basic certificate chain validation (signatures, dates, ...) is not\naffected, the denial of service can occur only when the application also\nspecifies an expected DNS name, Email address or IP address.\n\nTLS servers rarely solicit client certificates, and even when they do, they\ngenerally don't perform a name check against a reference identifier (expected\nidentity), but rather extract the presented identity after checking the\ncertificate chain.

flaw was found in GnuTLS. A double-free vulnerability exists in GnuTLS due to incorrect ownership handling in the export logic of Subject Alternative Name (SAN) entries containing an otherName. If the type-id OID is invalid or malformed, GnuTLS will call asn1_delete_structure() on an ASN.1 node it does not own, leading to a double-free condition when the parent function or caller later attempts to free the same structure.\n\nThis vulnerability can be triggered using only public GnuTLS APIs and may result in denial of service or memory corruption, depending on allocator behavior.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.2,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":4.3},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4.3},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-32988","epss":0.0021,"percentile":0.39191,"date":"2025-11-20"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-32988","cwe":"CWE-415","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"}]},{"id":"CVE-2025-6395","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-6395","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:16115","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:16116","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17181","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17348","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17361","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17415","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:19088","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-6395","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2376755","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/07/11/3","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/08/msg00005.html"],"description":"A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the GnuTLS software in _gnutls_figure_common_ciphersuite().","cvss":[{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4.3},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-6395","epss":0.00134,"percentile":0.27882,"date":"2025-11-20"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-6395","cwe":"CWE-476","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"}]},{"id":"CVE-2025-32989","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-32989","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:16115","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:16116","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17181","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17348","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:17361","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:19088","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-32989","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2359621","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/07/11/3"],"description":"A heap-buffer-overread vulnerability was found in GnuTLS in how it handles the Certificate Transparency (CT) Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT) extension during X.509 certificate parsing.
