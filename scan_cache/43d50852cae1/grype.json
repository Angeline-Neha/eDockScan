Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send.

The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45337","epss":0.42906,"percentile":0.97325,"date":"2025-10-31"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.14.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v778-237x-gjrc","versionConstraint":"<0.31.0 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.31.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"91d14d10b800c6c3","name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.14.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/caddy","layerID":"sha256:8a09b1f408d4da44adb591a1c66c4b71420a9f7a861b6fe1213bd8fd0f807be0","accessPath":"/usr/bin/caddy","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:go:ssh:v0.14.0:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/crypto@v0.14.0","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.5","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:wBqGXzWJW6m1XrIKlAH0Hs1JJ7+9KBwnIO8v66Q9cHc=","mainModule":"command-line-arguments"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-4v7x-pqxf-cx7m","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4v7x-pqxf-cx7m","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"net/http, x/net/http2: close connections when receiving too many headers","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45288","epss":0.66635,"percentile":0.98456,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.23.0"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"0.23.0","date":"2024-04-20","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":34.317025},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-45288","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45288","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/05/4","https://go.dev/cl/576155","https://go.dev/issue/65051","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/YgW0sx8mN3M","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QRYFHIQ6XRKRYBI2F5UESH67BJBQXUPT/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2687","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240419-0009/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/05/4","https://go.dev/cl/576155","https://go.dev/issue/65051","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/YgW0sx8mN3M","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QRYFHIQ6XRKRYBI2F5UESH67BJBQXUPT/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2687","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240419-0009/"],"description":"An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they\nbecome

summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an\nempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to\nbe sent to the peer.\n\nImpact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences\nsuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they\nbecome available.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","epss":0.07837,"percentile":0.91584,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"apk-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"alpine","version":"3.18.6"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.1.4-r5"},"namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.18"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-5535","versionConstraint":"<

Each such request leaves the proxy with an invalid connection, and causes one subsequent request using that connection to fail.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-24791","epss":0.00618,"percentile":0.69136,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.21.12","1.22.5"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.21.12","date":"2024-07-04","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.22.5","date":"2024-07-04","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.4635},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.21.5:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.21.5"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-24791","versionConstraint":"< 1.21.12,>= 1.22.0-0, < 1.22.5 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.21.12"}}],"artifact":{"id":"77f0c043a734dcdd","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.21.5","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/caddy","layerID":"sha256:8a09b1f408d4da44adb591a1c66c4b71420a9f7a861b6fe1213bd8fd0f807be0","accessPath":"/usr/bin/caddy","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.21.5:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.21.5","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.5","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-9143","dataSource":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2024-9143","namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.18","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-9143","epss":0.00652,"percentile":0.70108,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-9143","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-9143","cwe":"CWE-787","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.1.7-r1"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.1.7-r1","date":"2024-10-21","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.30318},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-9143","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9143","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/72ae83ad214d2eef262461365a1975707f862712","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/bc7e04d7c8d509fb78fc0e285aa948fb0da04700","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/c0d3e4d32d2805f49bec30547f225bc4d092e1f4","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/fdf6723362ca51bd883295efe206cb5b1cfa5154","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/8efc0cbaa8ebba8e116f7b81a876a4123594d86a","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/9d576994cec2b7aa37a91740ea7e680810957e41","https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20241016.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/10/16/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/10/23/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/10/24/1","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241101-0001/"],"description":"Issue summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted\nexplicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads\nor writes.\n\nImpact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or\neven a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols\ninvolving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only \"named\ncurves\" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they\nspecify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent\nproblematic input values.

is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. An off-path attacker can inject an ICMP Packet Too Large packet. Since affected quic-go versions used IP_PMTUDISC_DO, the kernel would then return a \"message too large\" error on sendmsg, i.e. when quic-go attempts to send a packet that exceeds the MTU claimed in that ICMP packet. By setting this value to smaller than 1200 bytes (the minimum MTU for QUIC), the attacker can disrupt a QUIC connection. Crucially, this can be done after completion of the handshake, thereby circumventing any TCP fallback that might be implemented on the application layer (for example, many browsers fall back to HTTP over TCP if they're unable to establish a QUIC connection). The attacker needs to at least know the client's IP and port tuple to mount an attack. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.48.2.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-53259","epss":0.00279,"percentile":0.51034,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-53259","cwe":"CWE-345","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/quic-go/quic-go","version":"v0.40.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-px8v-pp82-rcvr","versionConstraint":"<0.48.2 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.48.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"eb8b63b2774e5ad8","name":"github.com/quic-go/quic-go","version":"v0.40.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/caddy","layerID":"sha256:8a09b1f408d4da44adb591a1c66c4b71420a9f7a861b6fe1213bd8fd0f807be0","accessPath":"/usr/bin/caddy","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:quic-go:quic-go:v0.40.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:quic-go:quic_go:v0.40.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:quic_go:quic-go:v0.40.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:quic_go:quic_go:v0.40.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:quic:quic-go:v0.40.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:quic:quic_go:v0.40.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/quic-go/quic-go@v0.40.0","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.5","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:GYd1iznlKm7dpHD7pOVpUvItgMPo/jrMgDWZhMCecqw=","mainModule":"command-line-arguments"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-8r3f-844c-mc37","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8r3f-844c-mc37","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Golang protojson.Unmarshal function infinite loop when unmarshaling certain forms of invalid JSON","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-24786","epss":0.00231,"percentile":0.45918,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.33.0"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.33.0","date":"2024-03-14","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.144375},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-24786","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24786","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/569356","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JDMBHAVSDU2FBDZ45U3A2VLSM35OJ2HU/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2611","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240517-0002/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/569356","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JDMBHAVSDU2FBDZ45U3A2VLSM35OJ2HU/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2611","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240517-0002/"],"description":"The protojson.Unmarshal function can enter an infinite loop when unmarshaling certain forms of invalid JSON.
