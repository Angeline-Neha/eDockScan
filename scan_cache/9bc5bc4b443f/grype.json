Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45288","epss":0.64852,"percentile":0.98379,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.21.9","1.22.2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.21.9","date":"2024-04-06","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.22.2","date":"2024-04-06","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":48.638999999999996},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.20.8:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.20.8"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45288","versionConstraint":"< 1.21.9,>= 1.22.0-0, < 1.22.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.21.9"}}],"artifact":{"id":"23acdfc181e41886","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.20.8","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/registry","layerID":"sha256:811f3777554af05e129c61a8a5560c14039294055eaed4fb3b5d71537a22d694","accessPath":"/bin/registry","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.20.8:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.20.8","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.20.8","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-24787","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24787","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/08/3","https://go.dev/cl/583815","https://go.dev/issue/67119","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/wkkO4P9stm0","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2825","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240531-0006/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/08/3","https://go.dev/cl/583815","https://go.dev/issue/67119","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/wkkO4P9stm0","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2825","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240531-0006/"],"description":"On Darwin, building a Go module which contains CGO can trigger arbitrary code execution when using the Apple version of ld, due to usage of the -lto_library flag in a \"#cgo LDFLAGS\" directive.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.4,"exploitabilityScore":0.5,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-24787","epss":0.02135,"percentile":0.83634,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.21.10","1.22.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.21.10","date":"2024-05-14","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.22.3","date":"2024-05-14","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":1.2169500000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.20.8:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.20.8"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-24787","versionConstraint":"< 1.21.10,>= 1.22.0-0, < 1.22.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.21.10"}}],"artifact":{"id":"23acdfc181e41886","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.20.8","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/registry","layerID":"sha256:811f3777554af05e129c61a8a5560c14039294055eaed4fb3b5d71537a22d694","accessPath":"/bin/registry","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.20.8:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.20.8","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.20.8","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-24784","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24784","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/555596","https://go.dev/issue/65083","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2609","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0007/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/555596","https://go.dev/issue/65083","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2609","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0007/"],"description":"The ParseAddressList function incorrectly handles comments (text within parentheses) within display names.

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.0015,"percentile":0.36138,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.20.10","1.21.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.20.10","date":"2023-11-01","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.21.3","date":"2023-11-01","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.11250000000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.20.8:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.20.8"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-39325","versionConstraint":">=
