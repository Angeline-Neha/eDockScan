One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-50387","epss":0.39615,"percentile":0.97132,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-50387","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-50387","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"redhat","version":"8.9"},"package":{"name":"unbound","version":"1.16.2-5.el8"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-50387","versionConstraint":"< 0:1.16.2-5.el8_9.2 (rpm)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0:1.16.2-5.el8_9.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"e4536556a7b429b3","name":"unbound-libs","version":"1.16.2-5.el8","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","layerID":"sha256:0683b323fbf03fcaeb7eb4f387dffcc6d82438a5bba8e223eff8d5f84db75e55","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["BSD"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:unbound-libs:unbound-libs:1.16.2-5.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:unbound-libs:unbound_libs:1.16.2-5.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:unbound_libs:unbound-libs:1.16.2-5.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:unbound_libs:unbound_libs:1.16.2-5.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:unbound:unbound-libs:1.16.2-5.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:unbound:unbound_libs:1.16.2-5.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:unbound-libs:1.16.2-5.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:unbound_libs:1.16.2-5.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/redhat/unbound-libs@1.16.2-5.el8?arch=x86_64&distro=rhel-8.9&upstream=unbound-1.16.2-5.el8.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"unbound","version":"1.16.2-5.el8"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":null,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-48795","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-48795","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in the SSH channel integrity.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used.

In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time.

This issue has been present since `update_into` was originally introduced in cryptography 1.8.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-23931","epss":0.00717,"percentile":0.71641,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-23931","cwe":"CWE-754","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"redhat","version":"8.9"},"package":{"name":"python39","version":"3.9.18-1.module+el8.9.0+20024+793d7211"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-23931","versionConstraint":"< 0:3.9.18-3.module+el8.10.0+21142+453d2b75 (rpm)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0:3.9.18-3.module+el8.10.0+21142+453d2b75"}}],"artifact":{"id":"20ad53103bc1385b","name":"python39-libs","version":"3.9.18-1.module+el8.9.0+20024+793d7211","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","layerID":"sha256:0683b323fbf03fcaeb7eb4f387dffcc6d82438a5bba8e223eff8d5f84db75e55","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Python"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python39-libs:python39-libs:3.9.18-1.module\\+el8.9.0\\+20024\\+793d7211:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python39-libs:python39_libs:3.9.18-1.module\\+el8.9.0\\+20024\\+793d7211:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python39_libs:python39-libs:3.9.18-1.module\\+el8.9.0\\+20024\\+793d7211:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python39_libs:python39_libs:3.9.18-1.module\\+el8.9.0\\+20024\\+793d7211:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python39:python39-libs:3.9.18-1.module\\+el8.9.0\\+20024\\+793d7211:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python39:python39_libs:3.9.18-1.module\\+el8.9.0\\+20024\\+793d7211:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:python39-libs:3.9.18-1.module\\+el8.9.0\\+20024\\+793d7211:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:python39_libs:3.9.18-1.module\\+el8.9.0\\+20024\\+793d7211:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/redhat/python39-libs@3.9.18-1.module%2Bel8.9.0%2B20024%2B793d7211?arch=x86_64&distro=rhel-8.9&upstream=python39-3.9.18-1.module%2Bel8.9.0%2B20024%2B793d7211.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"python39","version":"3.9.18-1.module+el8.9.0+20024+793d7211"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":null,"modularityLabel":"python39:3.9:8090020230922213827:7484f1d1"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2018-1000880","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1000880","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"libarchive version commit 9693801580c0cf7c70e862d305270a16b52826a7 onwards (release v3.2.0 onwards) contains a CWE-20: Improper Input Validation vulnerability in WARC parser - libarchive/archive_read_support_format_warc.c, _warc_read() that can result in DoS - quasi-infinite run time and disk usage from tiny file.

XML/HTML attributes cannot contain spaces, `/`, `>`, or `=`, as each would then be interpreted as starting a separate attribute. If an application accepts keys (as opposed to only values) as user input, and renders these in pages that other users see as well, an attacker could use this to inject other attributes and perform XSS. The fix for CVE-2024-22195 only addressed spaces but not other characters. Accepting keys as user input is now explicitly considered an unintended use case of the `xmlattr` filter, and code that does so without otherwise validating the input should be flagged as insecure, regardless of Jinja version.

summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL\nto crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack\n\nImpact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted\nsources might terminate abruptly.\n\nA file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an\nuntrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but\nOpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12\nfiles from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will\nbe vulnerable to this issue.\n\nOpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),\nPKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()\nand PKCS12_newpass().\n\nWe have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this\nfunction is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-0727","epss":0.00213,"percentile":0.43886,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-0727","cwe":"CWE-476","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-0727","cwe":"CWE-476","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"cryptography","version":"41.0.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-9v9h-cgj8-h64p","versionConstraint":"<42.0.2 (python)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"42.0.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"f736602340e089a4","name":"cryptography","version":"41.0.7","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/cryptography-41.0.7.dist-info/METADATA","layerID":"sha256:2f1ea21497abf317ea28a0e1e7d271b15c264b8b754d73b49032f314d9f1b57b","accessPath":"/usr/local/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/cryptography-41.0.7.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/local/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/cryptography-41.0.7.dist-info/RECORD","layerID":"sha256:2f1ea21497abf317ea28a0e1e7d271b15c264b8b754d73b49032f314d9f1b57b","accessPath":"/usr/local/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/cryptography-41.0.7.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/usr/local/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/cryptography-41.0.7.dist-info/top_level.txt","layerID":"sha256:2f1ea21497abf317ea28a0e1e7d271b15c264b8b754d73b49032f314d9f1b57b","accessPath":"/usr/local/lib64/python3.9/site-packages/cryptography-41.0.7.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["Apache-2.0 OR BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:cryptography.io:cryptography:41.0.7:*:*:*:*:python:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cryptography.io:cryptography:41.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/cryptography@41.0.7","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-8194","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-8194","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in the Python tarfile module.

Applications that do not call this function are not\nvulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by\napplications.\n\nThe SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used\nwhen processing an incoming record from the network.

However since this\nfunction is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-0727","epss":0.00213,"percentile":0.43886,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-0727","cwe":"CWE-476","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-0727","cwe":"CWE-476","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"redhat","version":"8.9"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1k-12.el8_9"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-0727","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"3bdfc0861256b3e3","name":"openssl-libs","version":"1:1.1.1k-12.el8_9","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","layerID":"sha256:0683b323fbf03fcaeb7eb4f387dffcc6d82438a5bba8e223eff8d5f84db75e55","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL and ASL 2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl-libs:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl-libs:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl_libs:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl_libs:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/redhat/openssl-libs@1.1.1k-12.el8_9?arch=x86_64&distro=rhel-8.9&epoch=1&upstream=openssl-1.1.1k-12.el8_9.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1k-12.el8_9"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":1,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-38546","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-38546","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in the Curl package.

Specifically HttpURI\n and the browser may differ on the value of the host extracted from an \ninvalid URI and thus a combination of Jetty and a vulnerable browser may\n be vulnerable to a open redirect attack or to a SSRF attack if the URI \nis used after passing validation checks.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"emo@eclipse.org","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.7,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-6763","epss":0.00186,"percentile":0.40679,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-6763","cwe":"CWE-1286","source":"emo@eclipse.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-6763","cwe":"NVD-CWE-Other","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-http","version":"9.4.53.v20231009"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-qh8g-58pp-2wxh","versionConstraint":">=7.0.0,<=12.0.11 (unknown)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"12.0.12"}}],"artifact":{"id":"281545c07d98d237","name":"jetty-http","version":"9.4.53.v20231009","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/usr/share/java/kafka/jetty-http-9.4.53.v20231009.jar","layerID":"sha256:0683b323fbf03fcaeb7eb4f387dffcc6d82438a5bba8e223eff8d5f84db75e55","accessPath":"/usr/share/java/kafka/jetty-http-9.4.53.v20231009.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":["http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0, https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/epl-v10.php"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:org.eclipse.jetty.http:jetty-http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.eclipse.jetty.http:jetty_http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse-jetty-project:jetty-http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse-jetty-project:jetty_http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse_jetty_project:jetty-http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse_jetty_project:jetty_http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.eclipse.jetty.http:jetty:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.eclipse.jetty:jetty_http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse-jetty-project:jetty:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse_jetty_project:jetty:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.eclipse.jetty.http:http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse-jetty-project:http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse_jetty_project:http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.eclipse.jetty:jetty:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:org.eclipse.jetty:http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty-http:jetty-http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty-http:jetty_http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty_http:jetty-http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty_http:jetty_http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty-http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty_http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty-http:jetty:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty:jetty-http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty:jetty_http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty_http:jetty:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:http:jetty-http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:http:jetty_http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty-http:http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty_http:http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty:jetty:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:http:jetty:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jetty:http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:http:http:9.4.53.v20231009:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/org.eclipse.jetty/jetty-http@9.4.53.v20231009","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/usr/share/java/kafka/jetty-http-9.4.53.v20231009.jar","pomArtifactID":"jetty-http","pomGroupID":"org.eclipse.jetty","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"87faf21eb322753f0527bcb88c43e67044786369"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-4330","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-4330","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in CPython's tarfile module.

Prior to 3.1.5, An oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment detects calls to str.format allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to store a reference to a malicious string's format method, then pass that to a filter that calls it. No such filters are built-in to Jinja, but could be present through custom filters in an application. After the fix, such indirect calls are also handled by the sandbox.

is an extensible templating engine. Prior to 3.1.6, an oversight in how the Jinja sandboxed environment interacts with the |attr filter allows an attacker that controls the content of a template to execute arbitrary Python code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to control the content of a template. Whether that is the case depends on the type of application using Jinja. This vulnerability impacts users of applications which execute untrusted templates. Jinja's sandbox does catch calls to str.format and ensures they don't escape the sandbox. However, it's possible to use the |attr filter to get a reference to a string's plain format method, bypassing the sandbox.

When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2.

When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37891","epss":0.00142,"percentile":0.35049,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37891","cwe":"CWE-669","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"urllib3","version":"2.1.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-34jh-p97f-mpxf","versionConstraint":">=2.0.0,<2.2.2 (python)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.2.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"26bc0b3cc49a484b","name":"urllib3","version":"2.1.0","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/urllib3-2.1.0.dist-info/METADATA","layerID":"sha256:2f1ea21497abf317ea28a0e1e7d271b15c264b8b754d73b49032f314d9f1b57b","accessPath":"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/urllib3-2.1.0.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/urllib3-2.1.0.dist-info/RECORD","layerID":"sha256:2f1ea21497abf317ea28a0e1e7d271b15c264b8b754d73b49032f314d9f1b57b","accessPath":"/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/urllib3-2.1.0.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:urllib3:2.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/urllib3@2.1.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-31879","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-31879","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in wget.

This flaw allows an attacker to employ a binary plist input, potentially executing a denial of service (DoS) attack by exhausting CPU and RAM resources.","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-48564","epss":0.00107,"percentile":0.29597,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-48564","cwe":"CWE-400","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["0:3.6.8-56.el8_9.2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"0:3.6.8-56.el8_9.2","date":"2024-01-11","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[{"id":"RHSA-2024:0114","link":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0114"}],"risk":0.06152499999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-48564","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-48564","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://bugs.python.org/issue42103","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230929-0009/","https://bugs.python.org/issue42103","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00017.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230929-0009/"],"description":"read_ints in plistlib.py in Python through 3.9.1 is vulnerable to a potential DoS attack via CPU and RAM exhaustion when processing malformed Apple Property List files in binary format.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-48564","epss":0.00107,"percentile":0.29597,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-48564","cwe":"CWE-400","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"redhat","version":"8.9"},"package":{"name":"python3","version":"3.6.8-56.el8_9"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-48564","versionConstraint":"< 0:3.6.8-56.el8_9.2 (rpm)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0:3.6.8-56.el8_9.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"83e44f4c4aab017f","name":"python3-libs","version":"3.6.8-56.el8_9","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","layerID":"sha256:0683b323fbf03fcaeb7eb4f387dffcc6d82438a5bba8e223eff8d5f84db75e55","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Python"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python3-libs:python3-libs:3.6.8-56.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3-libs:python3_libs:3.6.8-56.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3_libs:python3-libs:3.6.8-56.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3_libs:python3_libs:3.6.8-56.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3:python3-libs:3.6.8-56.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3:python3_libs:3.6.8-56.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:python3-libs:3.6.8-56.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:python3_libs:3.6.8-56.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/redhat/python3-libs@3.6.8-56.el8_9?arch=x86_64&distro=rhel-8.9&upstream=python3-3.6.8-56.el8_9.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"python3","version":"3.6.8-56.el8_9"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":null,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-50602","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-50602","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"A security issue was found in Expat (libexpat).

First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which \"tar xf\" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages). NOTE: the official GNU Tar manual has an otherwise-empty directory for each \"tar xf\" in its Security Rules of Thumb; however, third-party advice leads users to run \"tar xf\" more than once into the same directory.","cvss":[{"source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","epss":0.00081,"percentile":0.24495,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","cwe":"CWE-24","source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"redhat","version":"8.9"},"package":{"name":"tar","version":"2:1.30-9.el8"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-45582","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"1435e8d59fac6b89","name":"tar","version":"2:1.30-9.el8","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","layerID":"sha256:0683b323fbf03fcaeb7eb4f387dffcc6d82438a5bba8e223eff8d5f84db75e55","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["GPLv3+"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redhat:tar:2\\:1.30-9.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:tar:tar:2\\:1.30-9.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/redhat/tar@1.30-9.el8?arch=x86_64&distro=rhel-8.9&epoch=2&upstream=tar-1.30-9.el8.src.rpm","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":2,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-q4rv-gq96-w7c5","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q4rv-gq96-w7c5","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"**UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED** GzipHandler causes part of request body to be seen as request body of a separate request","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.2,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-13009","epss":0.00056,"percentile":0.17471,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-13009","cwe":"CWE-404","source":"emo@eclipse.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["9.4.57.v20241219"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"9.4.57.v20241219","date":"2025-05-09","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.041159999999999995},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-13009","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-13009","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/jetty/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-q4rv-gq96-w7c5","https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/cve-assignement/-/issues/48"],"description":"In Eclipse Jetty versions 9.4.0 to 9.4.56 a buffer can be incorrectly released when confronted with a gzip error when inflating a request\nbody.

This issue can lead to undefined behavior, including compromised data confidentiality and integrity or crashes.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-5987","epss":0.00076,"percentile":0.23099,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-5987","cwe":"CWE-393","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"redhat","version":"8.9"},"package":{"name":"libssh","version":"0.9.6-10.el8_8"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-5987","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ff468273b07f352b","name":"libssh-config","version":"0.9.6-10.el8_8","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","layerID":"sha256:0683b323fbf03fcaeb7eb4f387dffcc6d82438a5bba8e223eff8d5f84db75e55","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["LGPLv2+"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssh-config:libssh-config:0.9.6-10.el8_8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh-config:libssh_config:0.9.6-10.el8_8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh_config:libssh-config:0.9.6-10.el8_8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh_config:libssh_config:0.9.6-10.el8_8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh:libssh-config:0.9.6-10.el8_8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssh:libssh_config:0.9.6-10.el8_8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:libssh-config:0.9.6-10.el8_8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:libssh_config:0.9.6-10.el8_8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/redhat/libssh-config@0.9.6-10.el8_8?arch=noarch&distro=rhel-8.9&upstream=libssh-0.9.6-10.el8_8.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"libssh","version":"0.9.6-10.el8_8"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":null,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-9086","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-9086","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"1.

This is fixed in versions 4.1.125.Final of netty-codec and 4.2.5.Final of netty-codec-compression.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":6.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-58057","epss":0.00034,"percentile":0.09254,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-58057","cwe":"CWE-409","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"io.netty:netty-codec","version":"4.1.100.Final"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3p8m-j85q-pgmj","versionConstraint":"<4.1.125.Final (unknown)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.1.125.Final"}}],"artifact":{"id":"8c165287a6f1e1bc","name":"netty-codec","version":"4.1.100.Final","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/usr/share/java/kafka/netty-codec-4.1.100.Final.jar","layerID":"sha256:0683b323fbf03fcaeb7eb4f387dffcc6d82438a5bba8e223eff8d5f84db75e55","accessPath":"/usr/share/java/kafka/netty-codec-4.1.100.Final.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":["https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:io.netty.codec:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty.codec:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-project:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-project:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_project:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_project:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-codec:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-codec:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_codec:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_codec:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty.codec:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-project:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_project:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:codec:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:codec:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-codec:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_codec:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:codec:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/io.netty/netty-codec@4.1.100.Final","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/usr/share/java/kafka/netty-codec-4.1.100.Final.jar","pomArtifactID":"netty-codec","pomGroupID":"io.netty","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"9c3c71e7cf3b8ce3bfc9fa52a524b9ca7ddf259c"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2020-35512","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-35512","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"A use-after-free flaw was found in D-Bus when a system has multiple usernames sharing the same UID.
