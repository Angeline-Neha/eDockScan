This is assumed to not happen in such a way\nthat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered\nnot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,\nand the severity is therefore considered low.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-2650","epss":0.9197,"percentile":0.99678,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-2650","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-2650","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u3"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-2650","versionConstraint":"< 1.1.1n-0+deb11u5 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u5"}}],"artifact":{"id":"376993f95330fe29","name":"libssl1.1","version":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u3","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:598399fdc4dd5a24e2bd552cc7637309c9a41d218b0978d27a01960aa8ffc36c","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:ec4a38999118b78eab6899b913a548cb0b2c9b68fd05aff846a56b628b597f38","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:ec4a38999118b78eab6899b913a548cb0b2c9b68fd05aff846a56b628b597f38","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssl1.1:libssl1.1:1.1.1n-0\\+deb11u3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libssl1.1@1.1.1n-0%2Bdeb11u3?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11&upstream=openssl","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-45288","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45288","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/05/4","https://go.dev/cl/576155","https://go.dev/issue/65051","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/YgW0sx8mN3M","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QRYFHIQ6XRKRYBI2F5UESH67BJBQXUPT/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2687","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240419-0009/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/05/4","https://go.dev/cl/576155","https://go.dev/issue/65051","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/YgW0sx8mN3M","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QRYFHIQ6XRKRYBI2F5UESH67BJBQXUPT/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2687","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240419-0009/","https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/421644"],"description":"An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames. Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45288","epss":0.64852,"percentile":0.98379,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.21.9","1.22.2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.21.9","date":"2024-04-06","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.22.2","date":"2024-04-06","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":48.638999999999996},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45288","versionConstraint":"< 1.21.9,>= 1.22.0-0, < 1.22.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.21.9"}}],"artifact":{"id":"355dda4d91d4eab4","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:95dff52c35dd01bceeb0b2d6c81effebc235df6f584591ec197c114b587a415c","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.16.7","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.7","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-31449","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31449","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/1f7c148be2cbacf7d50aa461c58b871e87cc5ed9","https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-whxg-wx83-85p5"],"description":"Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk.

One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-50387","epss":0.39615,"percentile":0.97132,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-50387","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-50387","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"systemd","version":"247.3-7+deb11u1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-50387","versionConstraint":"< 247.3-7+deb11u6 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"247.3-7+deb11u6"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a9d3737ab367b326","name":"libudev1","version":"247.3-7+deb11u1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:598399fdc4dd5a24e2bd552cc7637309c9a41d218b0978d27a01960aa8ffc36c","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libudev1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:ec4a38999118b78eab6899b913a548cb0b2c9b68fd05aff846a56b628b597f38","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libudev1/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libudev1:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:ec4a38999118b78eab6899b913a548cb0b2c9b68fd05aff846a56b628b597f38","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libudev1:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["CC0-1.0","Expat","GPL-2","GPL-2+","LGPL-2.1","LGPL-2.1+","public-domain"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libudev1:libudev1:247.3-7\\+deb11u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libudev1@247.3-7%2Bdeb11u1?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11&upstream=systemd","upstreams":[{"name":"systemd"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-24834","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24834","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-p8x2-9v9q-c838","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MIF5MAGYARYUMRFK7PQI7HYXMK2HZE5T/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TDNNH2ONMVNBQ6LUIAOAGDNFPKXNST5K/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230814-0006/","https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-p8x2-9v9q-c838","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MIF5MAGYARYUMRFK7PQI7HYXMK2HZE5T/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TDNNH2ONMVNBQ6LUIAOAGDNFPKXNST5K/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230814-0006/"],"description":"Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk.

Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling application.  The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports that there was no overlap in the lists).  This function is typically called from a server side application callback for ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\" response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it will be vulnerable to this problem.  In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of confidentiality will occur.  This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error. Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active exploitation unlikely.  The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.  Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they become available.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","epss":0.05822,"percentile":0.90122,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.1.1w-0+deb11u2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.1.1w-0+deb11u2","date":"2024-11-27","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":5.26891},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-5535","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5535","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4ada436a1946cbb24db5ab4ca082b69c1bc10f37","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/99fb785a5f85315b95288921a321a935ea29a51e","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/cf6f91f6121f4db167405db2f0de410a456f260c","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e86ac436f0bd54d4517745483e2315650fae7b2c","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/9947251413065a05189a63c9b7a6c1d4e224c21c","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/b78ec0824da857223486660177d3b1f255c65d87","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240627.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/27/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/28/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/08/15/1","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4ada436a1946cbb24db5ab4ca082b69c1bc10f37","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/99fb785a5f85315b95288921a321a935ea29a51e","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/cf6f91f6121f4db167405db2f0de410a456f260c","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e86ac436f0bd54d4517745483e2315650fae7b2c","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/9947251413065a05189a63c9b7a6c1d4e224c21c","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/b78ec0824da857223486660177d3b1f255c65d87","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/10/msg00033.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00000.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240712-0005/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241025-0006/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241025-0010/","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240627.txt"],"description":"Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an\nempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to\nbe sent to the peer.\n\nImpact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences\nsuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash.

By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script execution environment, an attacker with access to Redis prior to version 7.0.0 or 6.2.7 can inject Lua code that will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis user. The Lua script execution environment in Redis provides some measures that prevent a script from creating side effects that persist and can affect the execution of the same, or different script, at a later time. Several weaknesses of these measures have been publicly known for a long time, but they had no security impact as the Redis security model did not endorse the concept of users or privileges. With the introduction of ACLs in Redis 6.0, these weaknesses can be exploited by a less privileged users to inject Lua code that will execute at a later time, when a privileged user executes a Lua script. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.9,"exploitabilityScore":1.4,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24735","epss":0.02049,"percentile":0.83296,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24735","cwe":"CWE-94","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-24735","cwe":"CWE-94","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.2.7"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"6.2.7","date":"2022-07-05","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":1.4001500000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:5.0.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"redis","version":"5.0.14"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-24735","versionConstraint":"<

side-channel.","cvss":[{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-28834","epss":0.01705,"percentile":0.81716,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-28834","cwe":"CWE-327","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"gnutls28","version":"3.7.1-5+deb11u2"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-28834","versionConstraint":"<

Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1, with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped.

Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value\neven if it has already been found to be too large.\n\nAn application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained\nfrom an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThe function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.\nAn application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.\nThe other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and\nEVP_PKEY_param_check().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications\nwhen using the '-check' option.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-3446","epss":0.00949,"percentile":0.75626,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-3446","cwe":"CWE-606","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-3446","cwe":"CWE-1333","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u3"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-3446","versionConstraint":"< 1.1.1v-0~deb11u1 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.1v-0~deb11u1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"376993f95330fe29","name":"libssl1.1","version":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u3","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:598399fdc4dd5a24e2bd552cc7637309c9a41d218b0978d27a01960aa8ffc36c","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:ec4a38999118b78eab6899b913a548cb0b2c9b68fd05aff846a56b628b597f38","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:ec4a38999118b78eab6899b913a548cb0b2c9b68fd05aff846a56b628b597f38","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssl1.1:libssl1.1:1.1.1n-0\\+deb11u3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libssl1.1@1.1.1n-0%2Bdeb11u3?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11&upstream=openssl","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-33560","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33560","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Libgcrypt before 1.8.8 and 1.9.x before 1.9.3 mishandles ElGamal encryption because it lacks exponent blinding to address a side-channel attack against mpi_powm, and the window size is not chosen appropriately.

Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash.    This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream, SMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.  Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream.  The OpenSSL cms and smime command line applications are similarly affected.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-0215","epss":0.00401,"percentile":0.60069,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-0215","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-0215","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.1.1n-0+deb11u4"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u4","date":"2023-02-07","kind":"advisory"}]},"advisories":[{"id":"DSA-5343-1","link":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DSA-5343-1"}],"risk":0.30074999999999996},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-0215","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0215","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=8818064ce3c3c0f1b740a5aaba2a987e75bfbafd","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9816136fe31d92ace4037d5da5257f763aeeb4eb","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=c3829dd8825c654652201e16f8a0a0c46ee3f344","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230427-0007/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230427-0009/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=8818064ce3c3c0f1b740a5aaba2a987e75bfbafd","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9816136fe31d92ace4037d5da5257f763aeeb4eb","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=c3829dd8825c654652201e16f8a0a0c46ee3f344","https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0003","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230427-0007/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230427-0009/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240621-0006/","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt"],"description":"The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming\nASN.1 data via a BIO.

summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking excessively long X9.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow.  Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to generate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays.  Likewise, applications that use DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.  While DH_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817), DH_check_pub_key() doesn't make any of these checks, and is therefore vulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters.  Likewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a check for an excessively large P, it doesn't check for an excessively large Q.  An application that calls DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.  DH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.  An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.  The other functions affected by this are DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate().

is an in-memory database that persists on disk. On startup, Redis begins listening on a Unix socket before adjusting its permissions to the user-provided configuration. If a permissive umask(2) is used, this creates a race condition that enables, during a short period of time, another process to establish an otherwise unauthorized connection. This problem has existed since Redis 2.6.0-RC1. This issue has been addressed in Redis versions 7.2.2, 7.0.14 and 6.2.14. Users are advised to upgrade.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.  The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.  An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.  The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.

An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL rules.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":2.1,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24736","epss":0.00344,"percentile":0.5639,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24736","cwe":"CWE-476","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-24736","cwe":"CWE-476","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.2.7"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"6.2.7","date":"2022-07-05","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.14849333333333334},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:5.0.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"redis","version":"5.0.14"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-24736","versionConstraint":"< 6.2.7,= 7.0-rc1,= 7.0-rc2,= 7.0-rc3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.2.7"}}],"artifact":{"id":"575247f9aeec79c4","name":"redis","version":"5.0.14","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/redis-server","layerID":"sha256:598399fdc4dd5a24e2bd552cc7637309c9a41d218b0978d27a01960aa8ffc36c","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/redis-server","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:5.0.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:5.0.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/redis@5.0.14","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-4304","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-4304","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption implementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack.

is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In versions starting at 2.6 and prior to 7.4.3, An unauthenticated client can cause unlimited growth of output buffers, until the server runs out of memory or is killed. By default, the Redis configuration does not limit the output buffer of normal clients (see client-output-buffer-limit). Therefore, the output buffer can grow unlimitedly over time. As a result, the service is exhausted and the memory is unavailable. When password authentication is enabled on the Redis server, but no password is provided, the client can still cause the output buffer to grow from \"NOAUTH\" responses until the system will run out of memory. This issue has been patched in version 7.4.3. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable is to block access to prevent unauthenticated users from connecting to Redis. This can be done in different ways. Either using network access control tools like firewalls, iptables, security groups, etc, or enabling TLS and requiring users to authenticate using client side certificates.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-21605","epss":0.00107,"percentile":0.29644,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-21605","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.2.18","7.2.8","7.4.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"6.2.18","date":"2025-09-11","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"7.2.8","date":"2025-09-11","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"7.4.3","date":"2025-04-25","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.08025},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:5.0.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"redis","version":"5.0.14"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-21605","versionConstraint":">= 2.6, < 6.2.18,>= 7.0.0, < 7.2.8,>= 7.3, < 7.4.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.2.18"}},{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:5.0.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"redis","version":"5.0.14"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-21605","versionConstraint":">= 2.6, < 6.2.18,>= 7.0.0, < 7.2.8,>= 7.3, < 7.4.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.2.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"575247f9aeec79c4","name":"redis","version":"5.0.14","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/redis-server","layerID":"sha256:598399fdc4dd5a24e2bd552cc7637309c9a41d218b0978d27a01960aa8ffc36c","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/redis-server","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:5.0.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:5.0.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/redis@5.0.14","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-48367","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48367","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/bde62951accfc4bb0a516276fd0b4b307e140ce2","https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/6.2.19","https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/7.2.10","https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/7.4.5","https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/8.0.3","https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-4q32-c38c-pwgq"],"description":"Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk.

This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in runc 1.1.2. This fix changes `runc exec --cap` behavior such that the additional capabilities granted to the process being executed (as specified via `--cap` arguments) do not include inheritable capabilities. In addition, `runc spec` is changed to not set any inheritable capabilities in the created example OCI spec (`config.json`)

is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":6,"exploitabilityScore":6.9,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":6,"exploitabilityScore":1.8,"impactScore":3.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-43784","epss":0.00129,"percentile":0.33187,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-43784","cwe":"CWE-190","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v95c-p5hm-xq8f","versionConstraint":"<1.0.3 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.0.3"}}],"artifact":{"id":"83a6fbe6e8c0eaa7","name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.1","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:95dff52c35dd01bceeb0b2d6c81effebc235df6f584591ec197c114b587a415c","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:opencontainers:runc:v1.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/opencontainers/runc@v1.0.1","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.7","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:G18PGckGdAm3yVQRWDVQ1rLSLntiniKJ0cNRT2Tm5gs=","mainModule":"github.com/tianon/gosu"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-33601","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-33601","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"nscd: netgroup cache may terminate daemon on memory allocation failure  The Name Service Cache Daemon's (nscd) netgroup cache uses xmalloc or xrealloc and these functions may terminate the process due to a memory allocation failure resulting in a denial of service to the clients.

large RSA keys in certificate chains can cause a client/server to expend significant CPU time verifying signatures. With fix, the size of RSA keys transmitted during handshakes is restricted to <= 8192 bits. Based on a survey of publicly trusted RSA keys, there are currently only three certificates in circulation with keys larger than this, and all three appear to be test certificates that are not actively deployed. It is possible there are larger keys in use in private PKIs, but we target the web PKI, so causing breakage here in the interests of increasing the default safety of users of crypto/tls seems

Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring the timing would require either local access to the signing application or a very fast network connection with low latency.  There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular the NIST P-521 curve is affected.

form parsing can consume large amounts of CPU and memory when processing form inputs containing very large numbers of parts. This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders=.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24536","epss":0.00066,"percentile":0.20599,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24536","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-24536","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.8","1.20.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.19.8","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.20.3","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0495},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-24536","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.8,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"355dda4d91d4eab4","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:95dff52c35dd01bceeb0b2d6c81effebc235df6f584591ec197c114b587a415c","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.16.7","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.7","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-24539","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24539","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/491615","https://go.dev/issue/59720","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/MEb0UyuSMsU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1751","https://go.dev/cl/491615","https://go.dev/issue/59720","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/MEb0UyuSMsU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1751","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241129-0005/"],"description":"Angle brackets (<>) are not considered dangerous characters when inserted into CSS contexts.

Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct.

is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. In versions 1.2.7, 1.3.2 and 1.4.0-rc.2, an attacker can trick runc into misdirecting writes to /proc to other procfs files through the use of a racing container with shared mounts (we have also verified this attack is possible to exploit using a standard Dockerfile with docker buildx build as that also permits triggering parallel execution of containers with custom shared mounts configured). This redirect could be through symbolic links in a tmpfs or theoretically other methods such as regular bind-mounts. While similar, the mitigation applied for the related CVE, CVE-2019-19921, was fairly limited and effectively only caused runc to verify that when LSM labels are written they are actually procfs files.

While this could be used to create empty files, existing files would not be truncated. An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced. Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict this attack's scope but the exact scope of protection hasn't been analysed. This is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and Kubernetes. The issue is fixed in runc v1.1.14 and v1.2.0-rc3.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Using user namespaces restricts this attack fairly significantly such that the attacker can only create inodes in directories that the remapped root user/group has write access to. Unless the root user is remapped to an actual\nuser on the host (such as with rootless containers that don't use `/etc/sub[ug]id`), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to create inodes in world-writable directories.

Users unable to upgrade should avoid using an untrusted container image.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28642","epss":0.00011,"percentile":0.00921,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28642","cwe":"CWE-281","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28642","cwe":"CWE-59","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-g2j6-57v7-gm8c","versionConstraint":"<1.1.5 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.5"}}],"artifact":{"id":"83a6fbe6e8c0eaa7","name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.1","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:95dff52c35dd01bceeb0b2d6c81effebc235df6f584591ec197c114b587a415c","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:opencontainers:runc:v1.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/opencontainers/runc@v1.0.1","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.7","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:G18PGckGdAm3yVQRWDVQ1rLSLntiniKJ0cNRT2Tm5gs=","mainModule":"github.com/tianon/gosu"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-qw9x-cqr3-wc7r","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qw9x-cqr3-wc7r","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"runc container escape with malicious config due to /dev/console mount and related races","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-52565","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00528,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-52565","cwe":"CWE-61","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2025-52565","cwe":"CWE-363","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.2.8"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.2.8","date":"2025-11-06","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.006000000000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-52565","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-52565","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/01de9d65dc72f67b256ef03f9bfb795a2bf143b4","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/398955bccb7f20565c224a3064d331c19e422398","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/531ef794e4ecd628006a865ad334a048ee2b4b2e","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/9be1dbf4ac67d9840a043ebd2df5c68f36705d1d","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/aee7d3fe355dd02939d44155e308ea0052e0d53a","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/db19bbed5348847da433faa9d69e9f90192bfa64","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/de87203e625cd7a27141fb5f2ad00a320c69c5e8","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/ff94f9991bd32076c871ef0ad8bc1b763458e480","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-qw9x-cqr3-wc7r"],"description":"runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. Versions 1.0.0-rc3 through 1.2.7, 1.3.0-rc.1 through 1.3.2, and 1.4.0-rc.1 through 1.4.0-rc.2, due to insufficient checks when bind-mounting `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` inside the container, an attacker can trick runc into bind-mounting paths which would normally be made read-only or be masked onto a path that the attacker can write to. This attack is very similar in concept and application to CVE-2025-31133, except that it attacks a similar vulnerability in a different target (namely, the bind-mount of `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` as configured for all containers that allocate a console). This happens after `pivot_root(2)`, so this cannot be used to write to host files directly -- however, as with CVE-2025-31133, this can load to denial of service of the host or a container breakout by providing the attacker with a writable copy of `/proc/sysrq-trigger` or `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` (respectively). This issue is fixed in versions 1.2.8, 1.3.3 and

NOTE: This CVE is disputed because the OpenSSL security policy explicitly notes that any side channels which require same physical system to be detected are outside of the threat model for the software. The timing signal is so small that it is infeasible to be detected without having the attacking process running on the same physical system.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27587","epss":0.00032,"percentile":0.08578,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27587","cwe":"CWE-385","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u3"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-27587","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"376993f95330fe29","name":"libssl1.1","version":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u3","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:598399fdc4dd5a24e2bd552cc7637309c9a41d218b0978d27a01960aa8ffc36c","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:ec4a38999118b78eab6899b913a548cb0b2c9b68fd05aff846a56b628b597f38","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:ec4a38999118b78eab6899b913a548cb0b2c9b68fd05aff846a56b628b597f38","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssl1.1:libssl1.1:1.1.1n-0\\+deb11u3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libssl1.1@1.1.1n-0%2Bdeb11u3?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11&upstream=openssl","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-0563","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0563","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"Negligible","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in the util-linux chfn and chsh utilities when compiled with Readline support.
