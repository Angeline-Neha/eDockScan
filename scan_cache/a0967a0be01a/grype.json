If there was an issue trying to put that new transaction on the wire, it would close the connection handle, but read_answers() was still expecting the connection handle to be available to possibly dequeue other responses. In theory a remote attacker might be able to trigger this by flooding the target with ICMP UNREACHABLE packets if they also control the upstream nameserver and can return a result with one of those conditions, this has been untested.

Since pinning makes the transfer succeed if the pin is fine, users could unwittingly connect to an impostor server without noticing.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-5025","epss":0.00018,"percentile":0.03247,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-5025","cwe":"CWE-295","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"apk-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"alpine","version":"3.20.6"},"package":{"name":"curl","version":"8.12.1-r0"},"namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.20"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-5025","versionConstraint":"< 8.14.0-r0 (apk)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"8.14.0-r0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"2cf189f223e1ee2c","name":"libcurl","version":"8.12.1-r0","type":"apk","locations":[{"path":"/lib/apk/db/installed","layerID":"sha256:a0636672c7fc32af4d1022152a8e32256abd648fb01f48f33023839e65c6d1cb","accessPath":"/lib/apk/db/installed","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["curl"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libcurl:libcurl:8.12.1-r0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libcurl@8.12.1-r0?arch=x86_64&distro=alpine-3.20.6&upstream=curl","upstreams":[{"name":"curl"}],"metadataType":"ApkMetadata","metadata":{"files":[{"path":"/usr"},{"path":"/usr/lib"},{"path":"/usr/lib/libcurl.so.4"},{"path":"/usr/lib/libcurl.so.4.8.0"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-9231","dataSource":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2025-9231","namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.20","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-9231","epss":0.00015,"percentile":0.02394,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-9231","cwe":"CWE-385","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.3.5-r0"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.3.5-r0","date":"2025-10-01","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.008624999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-9231","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-9231","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/567f64386e43683888212226824b6a179885a0fe","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/cba616c26ac8e7b37de5e77762e505ba5ca51698","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/eed5adc9f969d77c94f213767acbb41ff923b6f4","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/fc47a2ec078912b3e914fab5734535e76c4820c2","https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20250930.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/09/30/5"],"description":"Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow remote\nrecovery of the private key exists in the SM2 algorithm implementation on 64 bit\nARM platforms.\n\nImpact summary: A timing side-channel in SM2 signature computations on 64 bit\nARM platforms could allow recovering the private key by an attacker..\n\nWhile remote key recovery over a network was not attempted by the reporter,\ntiming measurements revealed a timing signal which may allow such an attack.\n\nOpenSSL does not directly support certificates with SM2 keys in TLS, and so\nthis CVE is not relevant in most TLS contexts.
