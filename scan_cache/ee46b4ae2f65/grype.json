is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE. This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING.  When CRL checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read memory contents or enact a denial of service.

Impact summary: Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly, or use any of the OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message size limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those messages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.  An OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers - most of which have no size limit.  OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL type ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the sub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by periods.  When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large (these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds of KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long time.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the sub-identifiers in bytes (*).

It also impacts anything that processes X.509 certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.  The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a 100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client authentication.  In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects, such as X.509 certificates.

BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.

However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","metrics":{"baseScore":7.2,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":10.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-18276","epss":0.40022,"percentile":0.97154,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-18276","cwe":"CWE-273","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2019-18276","cwe":"CWE-273","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"10"},"package":{"name":"bash","version":"5.0-4"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-18276","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"cd34aee2896ce84f","name":"bash","version":"5.0-4","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:82068c842707f3491e7398973688d8abd66f1494f00e646d801be1545c539f1c","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/bash/copyright","layerID":"sha256:c2adabaecedbda0af72b153c6499a0555f3a769d52370469d8f6bd6328af9b13","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/bash/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:c2adabaecedbda0af72b153c6499a0555f3a769d52370469d8f6bd6328af9b13","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:c2adabaecedbda0af72b153c6499a0555f3a769d52370469d8f6bd6328af9b13","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.list","layerID":"sha256:c2adabaecedbda0af72b153c6499a0555f3a769d52370469d8f6bd6328af9b13","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.postinst","layerID":"sha256:c2adabaecedbda0af72b153c6499a0555f3a769d52370469d8f6bd6328af9b13","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.postinst"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.postrm","layerID":"sha256:c2adabaecedbda0af72b153c6499a0555f3a769d52370469d8f6bd6328af9b13","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.postrm"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.preinst","layerID":"sha256:c2adabaecedbda0af72b153c6499a0555f3a769d52370469d8f6bd6328af9b13","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.preinst"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.prerm","layerID":"sha256:c2adabaecedbda0af72b153c6499a0555f3a769d52370469d8f6bd6328af9b13","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.prerm"}],"language":"","licenses":["GPL-3"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:bash:bash:5.0-4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/bash@5.0-4?arch=amd64&distro=debian-10","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-2511","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-2511","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause unbounded memory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions  Impact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to trigger unbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service  This problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option is being used (but not if early_data support is also configured and the default anti-replay protection is in use).

The resolved name should return a large number of IPv6 and IPv4, and the call to the getaddrinfo function should have the AF_INET6 address family with AI_CANONNAME, AI_ALL and AI_V4MAPPED as flags.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","epss":0.01895,"percentile":0.82646,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"10"},"package":{"name":"glibc","version":"2.28-10"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-4806","versionConstraint":"none

An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.  The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.

Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value\neven if it has already been found to be too large.\n\nAn application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained\nfrom an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThe function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.\nAn application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.\nThe other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and\nEVP_PKEY_param_check().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications\nwhen using the '-check' option.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-3446","epss":0.00949,"percentile":0.75626,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-3446","cwe":"CWE-606","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-3446","cwe":"CWE-1333","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"10"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1d-0+deb10u3"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-3446","versionConstraint":"< 1.1.1n-0+deb10u6 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.1n-0+deb10u6"}}],"artifact":{"id":"5c4827ecb0c0c2aa","name":"libssl1.1","version":"1.1.1d-0+deb10u3","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:82068c842707f3491e7398973688d8abd66f1494f00e646d801be1545c539f1c","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:82068c842707f3491e7398973688d8abd66f1494f00e646d801be1545c539f1c","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:82068c842707f3491e7398973688d8abd66f1494f00e646d801be1545c539f1c","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssl1.1:libssl1.1:1.1.1d-0\\+deb10u3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libssl1.1@1.1.1d-0%2Bdeb10u3?arch=amd64&distro=debian-10&upstream=openssl","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2020-36329","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-36329","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10","severity":"Critical","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in libwebp in versions before 1.0.1.

OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue.

This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures).

public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by end user applications.  The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME.

One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the \"-crl_download\" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h).

Applications that do not call this function are not\nvulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by\napplications.\n\nThe SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used\nwhen processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected\nto succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have\nbeen identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.\n\nThe first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the\nnetwork and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived.\nIn this case calling SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though a record has only\nbeen partially processed and the buffer is still in use.\n\nThe second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has\nbeen received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of\nthis data. Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer\nis still in use.\n\nWhile these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a\nmalicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.\nWe are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4741","epss":0.00238,"percentile":0.46852,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4741","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"10"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1d-0+deb10u3"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-4741","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"5c4827ecb0c0c2aa","name":"libssl1.1","version":"1.1.1d-0+deb10u3","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:82068c842707f3491e7398973688d8abd66f1494f00e646d801be1545c539f1c","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:82068c842707f3491e7398973688d8abd66f1494f00e646d801be1545c539f1c","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:82068c842707f3491e7398973688d8abd66f1494f00e646d801be1545c539f1c","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssl1.1:libssl1.1:1.1.1d-0\\+deb10u3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libssl1.1@1.1.1d-0%2Bdeb10u3?arch=amd64&distro=debian-10&upstream=openssl","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2020-1751","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-1751","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"An out-of-bounds write vulnerability was found in glibc before 2.31 when handling signal trampolines on PowerPC.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.  The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.  An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.  The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.

summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack  Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted sources might terminate abruptly.  A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12 files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will be vulnerable to this issue.  OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes() and PKCS12_newpass().

These locations\ninclude the PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in\nOpenSSL 3.0.\n\nThe OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also impacted by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-4450","epss":0.00131,"percentile":0.3346,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-4450","cwe":"CWE-415","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-4450","cwe":"CWE-415","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"10"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1d-0+deb10u3"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-4450","versionConstraint":"< 1.1.1n-0+deb10u4 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.1n-0+deb10u4"}}],"artifact":{"id":"5c4827ecb0c0c2aa","name":"libssl1.1","version":"1.1.1d-0+deb10u3","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:82068c842707f3491e7398973688d8abd66f1494f00e646d801be1545c539f1c","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:82068c842707f3491e7398973688d8abd66f1494f00e646d801be1545c539f1c","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:82068c842707f3491e7398973688d8abd66f1494f00e646d801be1545c539f1c","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libssl1.1:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssl1.1:libssl1.1:1.1.1d-0\\+deb10u3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libssl1.1@1.1.1d-0%2Bdeb10u3?arch=amd64&distro=debian-10&upstream=openssl","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2019-3843","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-3843","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"It was discovered that a systemd service that uses DynamicUser property can create a SUID/SGID binary that would be allowed to run as the transient service UID/GID even after the service is terminated.
