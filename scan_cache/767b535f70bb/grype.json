attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames. Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45288","epss":0.64852,"percentile":0.98379,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.21.9","1.22.2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.21.9","date":"2024-04-06","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.22.2","date":"2024-04-06","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":48.638999999999996},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.21.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.21.3"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45288","versionConstraint":"< 1.21.9,>= 1.22.0-0, < 1.22.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.21.9"}}],"artifact":{"id":"932710c0ce5bbc79","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.21.3","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/nginx-ingress","layerID":"sha256:85ab34dab6374e89bb6661245c6e9638ff70f9593b03085f7f1b0d9fc6d46151","accessPath":"/nginx-ingress","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.21.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.21.3","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.3","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-v778-237x-gjrc","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v778-237x-gjrc","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Critical","urls":[],"description":"Misuse of ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback may cause authorization bypass in golang.org/x/crypto","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45337","epss":0.42906,"percentile":0.97329,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.31.0"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"0.31.0","date":"2024-12-12","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":38.829930000000004},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-45337","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45337","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://github.com/golang/crypto/commit/b4f1988a35dee11ec3e05d6bf3e90b695fbd8909","https://go.dev/cl/635315","https://go.dev/issue/70779","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/-nPEi39gI4Q/m/cGVPJCqdAQAJ","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-3321","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/12/11/2","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250131-0007/"],"description":"Applications and libraries which misuse connection.serverAuthenticate (via callback field ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback) may be susceptible to an authorization bypass. The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45337","epss":0.42906,"percentile":0.97329,"date":"2025-11-13"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.18.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v778-237x-gjrc","versionConstraint":"<0.31.0 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.31.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"39e433a5dbe2b7b0","name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.18.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/nginx-ingress","layerID":"sha256:85ab34dab6374e89bb6661245c6e9638ff70f9593b03085f7f1b0d9fc6d46151","accessPath":"/nginx-ingress","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:go:ssh:v0.18.0:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/crypto@v0.18.0","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.3","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:PGVlW0xEltQnzFZ55hkuX5+KLyrMYhHld1YHO4AKcdc=","mainModule":"github.com/nginxinc/kubernetes-ingress"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-50868","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-50868","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"The Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol (in RFC 5155 when RFC 9276 guidance is skipped) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption for SHA-1 computations) via DNSSEC responses in a random subdomain attack, aka the \"NSEC3\" issue.

Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send.

One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-50387","epss":0.39615,"percentile":0.97132,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-50387","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-50387","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"package":{"name":"systemd","version":"252.22-1~deb12u1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-50387","versionConstraint":"< 252.23-1~deb12u1 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"252.23-1~deb12u1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"2838de68fab1deda","name":"libudev1","version":"252.22-1~deb12u1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:a3bf8397c9879135cc35dbb5071eb093737dadba75f1cd49b111d91dc83590f0","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libudev1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:ceb365432eec83dafc777cac5ee87737b093095035c89dd2eae01970c57b1d15","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libudev1/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libudev1:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:ceb365432eec83dafc777cac5ee87737b093095035c89dd2eae01970c57b1d15","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libudev1:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["CC0-1.0","Expat","GPL-2","GPL-2+","LGPL-2.1","LGPL-2.1+","public-domain"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libudev1:libudev1:252.22-1\\~deb12u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libudev1@252.22-1~deb12u1?arch=amd64&distro=debian-12&upstream=systemd","upstreams":[{"name":"systemd"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-28182","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-28182","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"nghttp2 is an implementation of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2 in C.

Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling application.  The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports that there was no overlap in the lists).  This function is typically called from a server side application callback for ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\" response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it will be vulnerable to this problem.  In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of confidentiality will occur.  This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error. Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active exploitation unlikely.  The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.  Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of OpenSSL at this time.

In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they\nbecome available.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","epss":0.05822,"percentile":0.90122,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.0.11-1~deb12u2"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-5535","versionConstraint":"< 3.0.15-1~deb12u1 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.0.15-1~deb12u1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a6f022a6a999e5d3","name":"openssl","version":"3.0.11-1~deb12u2","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:a3bf8397c9879135cc35dbb5071eb093737dadba75f1cd49b111d91dc83590f0","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","layerID":"sha256:84619992a45bb790ab8f77ff523e52fc76dadfe17e205db6a111d0f657d31d71","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:84619992a45bb790ab8f77ff523e52fc76dadfe17e205db6a111d0f657d31d71","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:84619992a45bb790ab8f77ff523e52fc76dadfe17e205db6a111d0f657d31d71","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list","layerID":"sha256:84619992a45bb790ab8f77ff523e52fc76dadfe17e205db6a111d0f657d31d71","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst","layerID":"sha256:84619992a45bb790ab8f77ff523e52fc76dadfe17e205db6a111d0f657d31d71","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst"}],"language":"","licenses":["Apache-2.0","Artistic","GPL-1","GPL-1+"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:3.0.11-1\\~deb12u2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openssl@3.0.11-1~deb12u2?arch=amd64&distro=debian-12","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-28085","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-28085","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"wall in util-linux through 2.40, often installed with setgid tty permissions, allows escape sequences to be sent to other users' terminals through argv.

Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences.  The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for PowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different order than they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registers are corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only on newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.  The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application process. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.  The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data) algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies that TLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However we are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected by this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4.3},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-6129","epss":0.01861,"percentile":0.82488,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-6129","cwe":"CWE-440","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-6129","cwe":"CWE-787","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.0.13-1~deb12u1"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.0.13-1~deb12u1","date":"2024-06-30","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":1.070075},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-6129","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-6129","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/050d26383d4e264966fb83428e72d5d48f402d35","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/5b139f95c9a47a55a0c54100f3837b1eee942b04","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/f3fc5808fe9ff74042d639839610d03b8fdcc015","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240109.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/050d26383d4e264966fb83428e72d5d48f402d35","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/5b139f95c9a47a55a0c54100f3837b1eee942b04","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/f3fc5808fe9ff74042d639839610d03b8fdcc015","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240216-0009/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0008/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0013/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240503-0011/","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240109.txt"],"description":"Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation\ncontains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of applications running\non PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU provides vector instructions.\n\nImpact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC\nalgorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various\napplication dependent consequences.\n\nThe POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for\nPowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different order\nthan they are saved.

Impact summary: If an attacker can influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application state might be corrupted with various application dependent consequences.  The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code) implementation in OpenSSL for PowerPC CPUs restores the contents of vector registers in a different order than they are saved. Thus the contents of some of these vector registers are corrupted when returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only on newer PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions.  The consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the application process. However unless the compiler uses the vector registers for storing pointers, the most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result of some application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service.  The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data) algorithm.

Each such request leaves the proxy with an invalid connection, and causes one subsequent request using that connection to fail.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-24791","epss":0.00618,"percentile":0.69133,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.21.12","1.22.5"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.21.12","date":"2024-07-04","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.22.5","date":"2024-07-04","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.4635},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.21.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.21.3"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-24791","versionConstraint":"< 1.21.12,>= 1.22.0-0, < 1.22.5 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.21.12"}}],"artifact":{"id":"932710c0ce5bbc79","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.21.3","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/nginx-ingress","layerID":"sha256:85ab34dab6374e89bb6661245c6e9638ff70f9593b03085f7f1b0d9fc6d46151","accessPath":"/nginx-ingress","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.21.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.21.3","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.3","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-33599","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-33599","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"nscd: Stack-based buffer overflow in netgroup cache  If the Name Service Cache Daemon's (nscd) fixed size cache is exhausted by client requests then a subsequent client request for netgroup data may result in a stack-based buffer overflow.

Likewise, applications\nthat use DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()\nto check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH parameters may experience long delays.\nWhere the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from\nan untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nWhile DH_check() performs all the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817),\nDH_check_pub_key() doesn't make any of these checks, and is therefore\nvulnerable for excessively large P and Q parameters.\n\nLikewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a check for an excessively large\nP, it doesn't check for an excessively large Q.\n\nAn application that calls DH_generate_key() or DH_check_pub_key() and\nsupplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be\nvulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nDH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also called by a number of\nother OpenSSL functions.  An application calling any of those other\nfunctions may similarly be affected.

summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_free_buffers may cause memory to be accessed that was previously freed in some situations  Impact summary: A use after free can have a range of potential consequences such as the corruption of valid data, crashes or execution of arbitrary code. However, only applications that directly call the SSL_free_buffers function are affected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not vulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by applications.  The SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used when processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected to succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have been identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.  The first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the network and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived. In this case calling SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though a record has only been partially processed and the buffer is still in use.  The second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has been received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of this data. Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer is still in use.  While these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a malicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.

In versions on the 4.x branch prior to version 4.0.5, when parsing compact JWS or JWE input, Go JOSE could use excessive memory. The code used strings.Split(token, \".\") to split JWT tokens, which is vulnerable to excessive memory consumption when processing maliciously crafted tokens with a large number of `.` characters.  An attacker could exploit this by sending numerous malformed tokens, leading to memory exhaustion and a Denial of Service. Version 4.0.5 fixes this issue. As a workaround, applications could pre-validate that payloads passed to Go JOSE do not contain an excessive number of `.`

summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very slow.

Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.  The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform various checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time if the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.

For example, a chain of redirects from a.com/, to b.com/1, and finally to b.com/2 would incorrectly send the Authorization header to b.com/2.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45336","epss":0.00062,"percentile":0.19308,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.22.11","1.23.5","1.24.0-rc.2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.22.11","date":"2025-01-30","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.23.5","date":"2025-01-30","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.24.0-rc.2","date":"2025-02-06","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.034409999999999996},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.21.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.21.3"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-45336","versionConstraint":"< 1.22.11,>= 1.23.0-0, < 1.23.5,>= 1.24.0-0, < 1.24.0-rc.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.22.11"}}],"artifact":{"id":"932710c0ce5bbc79","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.21.3","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/nginx-ingress","layerID":"sha256:85ab34dab6374e89bb6661245c6e9638ff70f9593b03085f7f1b0d9fc6d46151","accessPath":"/nginx-ingress","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.21.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.21.3","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.3","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-34155","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-34155","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/611238","https://go.dev/issue/69138","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/S9POB9NCTdk","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-3105","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240926-0005/"],"description":"Calling any of the Parse functions on Go source code which contains deeply nested literals can cause a panic due to stack exhaustion.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.3,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-34155","epss":0.00073,"percentile":0.22585,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.22.7","1.23.1"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.22.7","date":"2024-09-10","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.23.1","date":"2024-09-10","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.033944999999999996},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.21.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.21.3"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-34155","versionConstraint":"< 1.22.7,>= 1.23.0-0, < 1.23.1 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.22.7"}}],"artifact":{"id":"932710c0ce5bbc79","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.21.3","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/nginx-ingress","layerID":"sha256:85ab34dab6374e89bb6661245c6e9638ff70f9593b03085f7f1b0d9fc6d46151","accessPath":"/nginx-ingress","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.21.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.21.3","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.3","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-9900","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-9900","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in Libtiff.

This flaw allows an attacker to force a SUID process to crash and replace it with a non-SUID binary to access the original's privileged process coredump, allowing the attacker to read sensitive data, such as /etc/shadow content, loaded by the original process.  A SUID binary or process has a special type of permission, which allows the process to run with the file owner's permissions, regardless of the user executing the binary. This allows the process to access more restricted data than unprivileged users or processes would be able to.

summary: An application using the OpenSSL HTTP client API functions may trigger an out-of-bounds read if the 'no_proxy' environment variable is set and the host portion of the authority component of the HTTP URL is an IPv6 address.  Impact summary: An out-of-bounds read can trigger a crash which leads to Denial of Service for an application.  The OpenSSL HTTP client API functions can be used directly by applications but they are also used by the OCSP client functions and CMP (Certificate Management Protocol) client implementation in OpenSSL. However the URLs used by these implementations are unlikely to be controlled by an attacker.  In this vulnerable code the out of bounds read can only trigger a crash. Furthermore the vulnerability requires an attacker-controlled URL to be passed from an application to the OpenSSL function and the user has to have a 'no_proxy' environment variable set. For the aforementioned reasons the issue was assessed as Low severity.  The vulnerable code was introduced in the following patch releases: 3.0.16, 3.1.8, 3.2.4, 3.3.3, 3.4.0 and 3.5.0.

failure in the -fstack-protector feature in GCC-based toolchains  that target AArch64 allows an attacker to exploit an existing buffer  overflow in dynamically-sized local variables in your application  without this being detected. This stack-protector failure only applies  to C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those created using  alloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for statically-sized  local variables.

The timing signal is so small that it is infeasible to be detected without having the attacking process running on the same physical system.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27587","epss":0.00032,"percentile":0.08578,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27587","cwe":"CWE-385","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"12"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.0.11-1~deb12u2"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-27587","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"a6f022a6a999e5d3","name":"openssl","version":"3.0.11-1~deb12u2","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:a3bf8397c9879135cc35dbb5071eb093737dadba75f1cd49b111d91dc83590f0","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","layerID":"sha256:84619992a45bb790ab8f77ff523e52fc76dadfe17e205db6a111d0f657d31d71","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:84619992a45bb790ab8f77ff523e52fc76dadfe17e205db6a111d0f657d31d71","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:84619992a45bb790ab8f77ff523e52fc76dadfe17e205db6a111d0f657d31d71","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list","layerID":"sha256:84619992a45bb790ab8f77ff523e52fc76dadfe17e205db6a111d0f657d31d71","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst","layerID":"sha256:84619992a45bb790ab8f77ff523e52fc76dadfe17e205db6a111d0f657d31d71","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst"}],"language":"","licenses":["Apache-2.0","Artistic","GPL-1","GPL-1+"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:3.0.11-1\\~deb12u2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openssl@3.0.11-1~deb12u2?arch=amd64&distro=debian-12","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-8534","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-8534","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:12","severity":"Negligible","urls":[],"description":"A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in libtiff 4.6.0.
