OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate\nan ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL\ntype ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the\nsub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by\nperiods.\n\nWhen one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large\n(these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds\nof KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long\ntime.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the\nsub-identifiers in bytes (*).\n\nWith OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names /\nidentifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT\nIDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching\nalgorithms.\n\nSuch OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure\nAlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify\nwhat cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or\ndecrypt, or digest passed data.\n\nApplications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are\naffected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose\nof display, the severity is considered low.\n\nIn OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME,\nCMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509\ncertificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.\n\nThe impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a\n100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only\nimpacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client\nauthentication.\n\nIn OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects,\nsuch as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way\nthat it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered\nnot affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern,\nand the severity is therefore considered low.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-2650","epss":0.9197,"percentile":0.99678,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-2650","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-2650","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"redhat","version":"8.9"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1k-12.el8_9"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-2650","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"3bdfc0861256b3e3","name":"openssl-libs","version":"1:1.1.1k-12.el8_9","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","layerID":"sha256:c2c0648295060b7925aaf873764832d8c6bde0f0b4a8efbb4ad06c77782d21da","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL and ASL 2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl-libs:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl-libs:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl_libs:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl_libs:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/redhat/openssl-libs@1.1.1k-12.el8_9?arch=x86_64&distro=rhel-8.9&epoch=1&upstream=openssl-1.1.1k-12.el8_9.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1k-12.el8_9"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":1,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-48795","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-48795","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in the SSH channel integrity.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

This issue is only exploitable if the application is misconfigured to use a zero-length server list and mishandles the 'no overlap' response in ALPN or uses the output as the opportunistic protocol in NPN.","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.0","vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","epss":0.05822,"percentile":0.90122,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1:1.1.1k-14.el8_6"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1:1.1.1k-14.el8_6","date":"2024-10-11","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[{"id":"RHSA-2024:7848","link":"https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:7848"}],"risk":2.5907900000000006},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-5535","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5535","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4ada436a1946cbb24db5ab4ca082b69c1bc10f37","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/99fb785a5f85315b95288921a321a935ea29a51e","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/cf6f91f6121f4db167405db2f0de410a456f260c","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e86ac436f0bd54d4517745483e2315650fae7b2c","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/9947251413065a05189a63c9b7a6c1d4e224c21c","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/b78ec0824da857223486660177d3b1f255c65d87","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240627.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/27/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/28/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/08/15/1","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4ada436a1946cbb24db5ab4ca082b69c1bc10f37","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/99fb785a5f85315b95288921a321a935ea29a51e","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/cf6f91f6121f4db167405db2f0de410a456f260c","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e86ac436f0bd54d4517745483e2315650fae7b2c","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/9947251413065a05189a63c9b7a6c1d4e224c21c","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/b78ec0824da857223486660177d3b1f255c65d87","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/10/msg00033.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00000.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240712-0005/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241025-0006/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241025-0010/","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240627.txt"],"description":"Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an\nempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to\nbe sent to the peer.\n\nImpact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences\nsuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they\nbecome available.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","epss":0.05822,"percentile":0.90122,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"redhat","version":"8.9"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1k-12.el8_9"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-5535","versionConstraint":"< 1:1.1.1k-14.el8_6 (rpm)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1:1.1.1k-14.el8_6"}}],"artifact":{"id":"3bdfc0861256b3e3","name":"openssl-libs","version":"1:1.1.1k-12.el8_9","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","layerID":"sha256:c2c0648295060b7925aaf873764832d8c6bde0f0b4a8efbb4ad06c77782d21da","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL and ASL 2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl-libs:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl-libs:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl_libs:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl_libs:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/redhat/openssl-libs@1.1.1k-12.el8_9?arch=x86_64&distro=rhel-8.9&epoch=1&upstream=openssl-1.1.1k-12.el8_9.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1k-12.el8_9"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":1,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2019-17543","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-17543","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"LZ4 before 1.9.2 has a heap-based buffer overflow in LZ4_write32 (related to LZ4_compress_destSize), affecting applications that call LZ4_compress_fast with a large input.

Applications that do not call this function are not\nvulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by\napplications.\n\nThe SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used\nwhen processing an incoming record from the network. The call is only expected\nto succeed if the buffer is not currently in use. However, two scenarios have\nbeen identified where the buffer is freed even when still in use.\n\nThe first scenario occurs where a record header has been received from the\nnetwork and processed by OpenSSL, but the full record body has not yet arrived.\nIn this case calling SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though a record has only\nbeen partially processed and the buffer is still in use.\n\nThe second scenario occurs where a full record containing application data has\nbeen received and processed by OpenSSL but the application has only read part of\nthis data. Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer\nis still in use.\n\nWhile these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a\nmalicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.\nWe are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4741","epss":0.00238,"percentile":0.46852,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4741","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"redhat","version":"8.9"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1k-12.el8_9"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-4741","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"3bdfc0861256b3e3","name":"openssl-libs","version":"1:1.1.1k-12.el8_9","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","layerID":"sha256:c2c0648295060b7925aaf873764832d8c6bde0f0b4a8efbb4ad06c77782d21da","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL and ASL 2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl-libs:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl-libs:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl_libs:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl_libs:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openssl-libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:openssl_libs:1\\:1.1.1k-12.el8_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/redhat/openssl-libs@1.1.1k-12.el8_9?arch=x86_64&distro=rhel-8.9&epoch=1&upstream=openssl-1.1.1k-12.el8_9.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1k-12.el8_9"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":1,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-26458","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-26458","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"A memory leak flaw was found in krb5 in /krb5/src/lib/rpc/pmap_rmt.c.

First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which \"tar xf\" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages). NOTE: the official GNU Tar manual has an otherwise-empty directory for each \"tar xf\" in its Security Rules of Thumb; however, third-party advice leads users to run \"tar xf\" more than once into the same directory.","cvss":[{"source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","epss":0.00081,"percentile":0.24495,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","cwe":"CWE-24","source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"redhat","version":"8.9"},"package":{"name":"tar","version":"2:1.30-9.el8"},"namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-45582","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"d3a15c655c02a9d6","name":"tar","version":"2:1.30-9.el8","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","layerID":"sha256:c2c0648295060b7925aaf873764832d8c6bde0f0b4a8efbb4ad06c77782d21da","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["GPLv3+"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redhat:tar:2\\:1.30-9.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:tar:tar:2\\:1.30-9.el8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/redhat/tar@1.30-9.el8?arch=x86_64&distro=rhel-8.9&epoch=2&upstream=tar-1.30-9.el8.src.rpm","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":2,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-5987","dataSource":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2025-5987","namespace":"redhat:distro:redhat:8","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in libssh when using the ChaCha20 cipher with the OpenSSL library.
