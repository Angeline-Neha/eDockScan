When zgrep is applied on the attacker's chosen file name (for example, a crafted file name), this can overwrite an attacker's content to an arbitrary attacker-selected file. This flaw occurs due to insufficient validation when processing filenames with two or more newlines where selected content and the target file names are embedded in crafted multi-line file names. This flaw allows a remote, low privileged attacker to force zgrep to write arbitrary files on the system.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-1271","epss":0.00716,"percentile":0.7165,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-1271","cwe":"CWE-179","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-1271","cwe":"CWE-20","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"9"},"package":{"name":"xz-utils","version":"5.2.2-1.2"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:9"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-1271","versionConstraint":"< 5.2.2-1.2+deb9u1 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"5.2.2-1.2+deb9u1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"ce8c009d3681b1d3","name":"liblzma5","version":"5.2.2-1.2+b1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:7c5a5c1986b16b0d8ad4eaa8066627910ec7794a657467e8f18d223f1c0034fd","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/liblzma5/copyright","layerID":"sha256:2b83e5699838047f936a3875bcce7fe1b169983bf86785ae7519c5bc488558ae","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/liblzma5/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/liblzma5:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:2b83e5699838047f936a3875bcce7fe1b169983bf86785ae7519c5bc488558ae","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/liblzma5:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Autoconf","GPL-2","GPL-2+","GPL-3","LGPL-2","LGPL-2.1","LGPL-2.1+","PD","PD-debian","config-h","noderivs","permissive-fsf","permissive-nowarranty","probably-PD"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:liblzma5:liblzma5:5.2.2-1.2\\+b1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/liblzma5@5.2.2-1.2%2Bb1?arch=amd64&distro=debian-9&upstream=xz-utils%405.2.2-1.2","upstreams":[{"name":"xz-utils","version":"5.2.2-1.2"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-1271","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1271","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:9","severity":"High","urls":[],"cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-1271","epss":0.00716,"percentile":0.7165,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-1271","cwe":"CWE-179","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-1271","cwe":"CWE-20","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["5.2.2-1.2+deb9u1"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"5.2.2-1.2+deb9u1","date":"2022-04-11","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.5835400000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-1271","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1271","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1271","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2073310","https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git%3Ba=commit%3Bh=69d1b3fc29677af8ade8dc15dba83f0589cb63d6","https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gzip/2022-04/msg00011.html","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1271","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-01","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220930-0006/","https://tukaani.org/xz/xzgrep-ZDI-CAN-16587.patch","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/07/8","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1271","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2073310","https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git%3Ba=commit%3Bh=69d1b3fc29677af8ade8dc15dba83f0589cb63d6","https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gzip/2022-04/msg00011.html","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1271","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-01","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220930-0006/","https://tukaani.org/xz/xzgrep-ZDI-CAN-16587.patch","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/07/8"],"description":"An arbitrary file write vulnerability was found in GNU gzip's zgrep utility.
