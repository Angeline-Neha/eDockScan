summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an\nempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to\nbe sent to the peer.\n\nImpact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences\nsuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they\nbecome

summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an\nempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to\nbe sent to the peer.\n\nImpact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences\nsuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they\nbecome available.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","epss":0.05822,"percentile":0.90122,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"apk-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"alpine","version":"3.18.4"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.1.4-r0"},"namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.18"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-5535","versionConstraint":"< 3.1.6-r0 (apk)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.1.6-r0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"4300bd203dc9ee5b","name":"libssl3","version":"3.1.4-r0","type":"apk","locations":[{"path":"/lib/apk/db/installed","layerID":"sha256:0a6928cbdb924d5f3654063fe6a1f328f57ee7049c2d6bd7308fe9e2fee10738","accessPath":"/lib/apk/db/installed","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssl3:libssl3:3.1.4-r0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl3:libssl:3.1.4-r0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl:libssl3:3.1.4-r0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl:libssl:3.1.4-r0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libssl3@3.1.4-r0?arch=aarch64&distro=alpine-3.18.4&upstream=openssl","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl"}],"metadataType":"ApkMetadata","metadata":{"files":[{"path":"/lib"},{"path":"/lib/libssl.so.3"},{"path":"/usr"},{"path":"/usr/lib"},{"path":"/usr/lib/libssl.so.3"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-2511","dataSource":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2024-2511","namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.18","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-2511","epss":0.03671,"percentile":0.874,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-2511","cwe":"CWE-1325","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.1.4-r6"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.1.4-r6","date":"2024-04-10","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":2.0006950000000003},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-2511","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2511","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/7e4d731b1c07201ad9374c1cd9ac5263bdf35bce","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/b52867a9f618bb955bed2a3ce3db4d4f97ed8e5d","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e9d7083e241670332e0443da0f0d4ffb52829f08","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/5f8d25770ae6437db119dfc951e207271a326640","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240408.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/08/5","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/7e4d731b1c07201ad9374c1cd9ac5263bdf35bce","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/b52867a9f618bb955bed2a3ce3db4d4f97ed8e5d","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e9d7083e241670332e0443da0f0d4ffb52829f08","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/5f8d25770ae6437db119dfc951e207271a326640","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/10/msg00033.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00000.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240503-0013/","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240408.txt"],"description":"Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause unbounded\nmemory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions\n\nImpact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to trigger\nunbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service\n\nThis problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option is\nbeing used (but not if early_data support is also configured and the default\nanti-replay protection is in use).

The other functions affected by this\nare DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the\n\"-pubcheck\" option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-5678","epss":0.00527,"percentile":0.66275,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-5678","cwe":"CWE-606","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-5678","cwe":"CWE-754","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"apk-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"alpine","version":"3.18.4"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.1.4-r0"},"namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.18"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-5678","versionConstraint":"< 3.1.4-r1 (apk)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.1.4-r1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"4300bd203dc9ee5b","name":"libssl3","version":"3.1.4-r0","type":"apk","locations":[{"path":"/lib/apk/db/installed","layerID":"sha256:0a6928cbdb924d5f3654063fe6a1f328f57ee7049c2d6bd7308fe9e2fee10738","accessPath":"/lib/apk/db/installed","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssl3:libssl3:3.1.4-r0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl3:libssl:3.1.4-r0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl:libssl3:3.1.4-r0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl:libssl:3.1.4-r0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libssl3@3.1.4-r0?arch=aarch64&distro=alpine-3.18.4&upstream=openssl","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl"}],"metadataType":"ApkMetadata","metadata":{"files":[{"path":"/lib"},{"path":"/lib/libssl.so.3"},{"path":"/usr"},{"path":"/usr/lib"},{"path":"/usr/lib/libssl.so.3"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-31079","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-31079","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/30/4","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MLAOKJWDALQZBIV3WKGPJ6T5Z56D3PRD/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/R7RPLWC35WHEUFCGKNFG62ESNID25TEZ/","https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000139611","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/30/4","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MLAOKJWDALQZBIV3WKGPJ6T5Z56D3PRD/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/R7RPLWC35WHEUFCGKNFG62ESNID25TEZ/","https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000139611"],"description":"When NGINX Plus or NGINX OSS are configured to use the HTTP/3 QUIC module, undisclosed HTTP/3 requests can cause NGINX worker processes to terminate or cause other potential impact.

summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_free_buffers may cause\nmemory to be accessed that was previously freed in some situations\n\nImpact summary: A use after free can have a range of potential consequences such\nas the corruption of valid data, crashes or execution of arbitrary code.\nHowever, only applications that directly call the SSL_free_buffers function are\naffected by this issue. Applications that do not call this function are not\nvulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by\napplications.\n\nThe SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used\nwhen processing an incoming record from the network.

The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but\nOpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12\nfiles from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will\nbe vulnerable to this issue.\n\nOpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),\nPKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()\nand PKCS12_newpass().\n\nWe have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7().

summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow recovering\nthe private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.\n\nImpact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations\ncould allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring\nthe timing would require either local access to the signing application or\na very fast network connection with low latency.\n\nThere is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of\nthe inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero.

Where the key or parameters that are being checked\nhave been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of\nService.\n\nThe functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform\nvarious checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time\nif the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.\n\nTrying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using\npublic keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature\nverification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit\nthe modulus size when performing the checks.\n\nAn application that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()\nand supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be\nvulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThese functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so\nonly applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications\nwhen using the `-check` option.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4603","epss":0.00092,"percentile":0.2655,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4603","cwe":"CWE-606","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-4603","cwe":"CWE-834","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"apk-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"alpine","version":"3.18.4"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.1.4-r0"},"namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.18"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-4603","versionConstraint":"<
