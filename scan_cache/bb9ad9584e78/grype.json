As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect\napplications which have implemented their own functionality for retrieving CRLs\nover a network.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-0286","epss":0.88981,"percentile":0.99495,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-0286","cwe":"CWE-843","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-0286","cwe":"CWE-843","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"python-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"python","namespace":"github:language:python","package":{"name":"cryptography","version":"3.2.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-x4qr-2fvf-3mr5","versionConstraint":">=0.8.1,<39.0.1 (python)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"39.0.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"fa80b2d5f726ed78","name":"cryptography","version":"3.2.1","type":"python","locations":[{"path":"/usr/lib/mysqlsh/lib/python3.9/site-packages/cryptography-3.2.1.dist-info/METADATA","layerID":"sha256:337ec6bae2225e56895f25ef88a874b2796e020332d63a35929f40e9e7fa158e","accessPath":"/usr/lib/mysqlsh/lib/python3.9/site-packages/cryptography-3.2.1.dist-info/METADATA","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/lib/mysqlsh/lib/python3.9/site-packages/cryptography-3.2.1.dist-info/RECORD","layerID":"sha256:337ec6bae2225e56895f25ef88a874b2796e020332d63a35929f40e9e7fa158e","accessPath":"/usr/lib/mysqlsh/lib/python3.9/site-packages/cryptography-3.2.1.dist-info/RECORD","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/usr/lib/mysqlsh/lib/python3.9/site-packages/cryptography-3.2.1.dist-info/direct_url.json","layerID":"sha256:337ec6bae2225e56895f25ef88a874b2796e020332d63a35929f40e9e7fa158e","accessPath":"/usr/lib/mysqlsh/lib/python3.9/site-packages/cryptography-3.2.1.dist-info/direct_url.json","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/usr/lib/mysqlsh/lib/python3.9/site-packages/cryptography-3.2.1.dist-info/top_level.txt","layerID":"sha256:337ec6bae2225e56895f25ef88a874b2796e020332d63a35929f40e9e7fa158e","accessPath":"/usr/lib/mysqlsh/lib/python3.9/site-packages/cryptography-3.2.1.dist-info/top_level.txt","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"python","licenses":["BSD or Apache License, Version 2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:cryptography.io:cryptography:3.2.1:*:*:*:*:python:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cryptography.io:cryptography:3.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:pypi/cryptography@3.2.1","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"ELSA-2025-1601","dataSource":"https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2025-1601.html","namespace":"oracle:distro:oraclelinux:7","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://linux.oracle.com/cve/CVE-2020-11023.html"],"description":"[4.8.5-45.0.1]\n- [Orabug: 37603707]\n  ELSA-2025-1601 Moderate: gcc security update CVE-2020-11023\n  rebuild for CVE-2020-11023\n- Reviewed-by: Jose E.

Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45288","epss":0.64852,"percentile":0.98379,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.21.9","1.22.2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.21.9","date":"2024-04-06","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.22.2","date":"2024-04-06","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":48.638999999999996},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45288","versionConstraint":"<

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m).

BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m).

do not properly consider backticks (`) as Javascript string delimiters, and do not escape them as expected. Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1, with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped. This should be used with caution.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24538","epss":0.00646,"percentile":0.69925,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24538","cwe":"CWE-94","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-24538","cwe":"CWE-94","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.8","1.20.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.19.8","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.20.3","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.60724},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-24538","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.8,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"856ae5282dfeec9e","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:8b2952eb02aac23a82803bf3e25d94ea78f3d4674d972cc7324a712ad9d54b6f","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.18.2","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.2","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-3ww4-gg4f-jr7f","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3ww4-gg4f-jr7f","namespace":"github:language:python","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Python Cryptography package vulnerable to Bleichenbacher timing oracle attack","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-50782","epss":0.00707,"percentile":0.71402,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-50782","cwe":"CWE-208","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-50782","cwe":"CWE-203","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["42.0.0"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"42.0.0","date":"2024-02-06","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.53025},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-50782","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-50782","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-50782","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2254432","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-50782","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2254432","https://www.couchbase.com/alerts/"],"description":"A flaw was found in the python-cryptography package.

strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-3712","epss":0.00486,"percentile":0.64519,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-3712","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"oraclelinux","version":"7.9"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1:1.0.2k-26.el7_9"},"namespace":"oracle:distro:oraclelinux:7"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"ELSA-2022-9023","versionConstraint":"<

strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own \"d2i\" functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the \"data\" and \"length\" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application without NUL terminating the \"data\" field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":8.6,"impactScore":5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-3712","epss":0.00486,"percentile":0.64519,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-3712","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"oraclelinux","version":"7.9"},"package":{"name":"openssl-libs","version":"1:1.0.2k-26.el7_9"},"namespace":"oracle:distro:oraclelinux:7"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"ELSA-2022-9023","versionConstraint":"< 10:1.0.2k-23.0.1.el7_9_fips (rpm)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"10:1.0.2k-23.0.1.el7_9_fips"}}],"artifact":{"id":"73bc308e7407bd87","name":"openssl-libs","version":"1:1.0.2k-26.el7_9","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","layerID":"sha256:337ec6bae2225e56895f25ef88a874b2796e020332d63a35929f40e9e7fa158e","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/Packages","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:oracleamerica:openssl-libs:1\\:1.0.2k-26.el7_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:oracleamerica:openssl_libs:1\\:1.0.2k-26.el7_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl-libs:openssl-libs:1\\:1.0.2k-26.el7_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl-libs:openssl_libs:1\\:1.0.2k-26.el7_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl_libs:openssl-libs:1\\:1.0.2k-26.el7_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl_libs:openssl_libs:1\\:1.0.2k-26.el7_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl-libs:1\\:1.0.2k-26.el7_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl_libs:1\\:1.0.2k-26.el7_9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/ol/openssl-libs@1.0.2k-26.el7_9?arch=x86_64&distro=ol-7.9&epoch=1&upstream=openssl-1.0.2k-26.el7_9.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl","version":"1.0.2k-26.el7_9"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":1,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-24783","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24783","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/569339","https://go.dev/issue/65390","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2598","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0005/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/569339","https://go.dev/issue/65390","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2598","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0005/"],"description":"Verifying a certificate chain which contains a certificate with an unknown public key algorithm will cause Certificate.Verify to panic.

ksu, without the -e flag, also check .k5users (#1105489)\n  When ksu was explicitly told to spawn a shell, a line in .k5users which\n  listed '*' as the allowed command would cause the principal named on the\n  line to be considered as a candidate for authentication.\n  When ksu was not passed a command to run, which implicitly meant that\n  the invoking user wanted to run the target user's login shell, knowledge\n  that the principal was a valid candidate was ignored, which could cause\n  a less optimal choice of the default target principal.\n  This doesn't impact the authorization checks

and\n  instead set default_ccache_name in the default krb5.conf's [libdefaults]\n  section (#991148)\n- on releases where we expect krb5.conf to be configured with a\n  default_ccache_name, add it whenever we upgrade from an older version of\n  the package that wouldn't have included it in its default configuration\n  file (#991148)\n\n[1.11.3-9]\n- take another stab at accounting for UnversionedDocdirs for the -libs\n  subpackage (spotted by ssorce)\n- switch to just the snapshot of nss_wrapper we were using, since we\n  no longer need to carry anything that isn't in the cwrap.org

(#978756)\n- cover inconsistencies in whether or not there's a local caching nameserver\n  that's willing to answer when the build environment doesn't have a\n  resolver configuration, so that nss_wrapper's faking of the local\n  hostname can be complete\n\n[1.11.3-3]\n- specify dependencies on the same arch of krb5-libs by using the %{?_isa}\n  suffix, to avoid dragging 32-bit libraries onto 64-bit systems (#980155)\n\n[1.11.3-2]\n- special-case /run/user/0, attempting to create it when resolving a\n  directory cache below it fails due to ENOENT and we find that it doesn't\n  already exist, either, before attempting to create the directory cache\n  (maybe helping, maybe just making things more confusing for #961235)\n\n[1.11.3-1]\n- update to 1.11.3\n  - drop patch for RT#7605,

docs to -workstation, so\n  that just having something that links to the libraries won't drag\n  them onto a system, and we avoid having to sort out hard-coded paths\n  that include %{_libdir} showing up in docs in multilib packages\n- actually create %{_var}/kerberos/kdc/user, so that it can be packaged\n- correct the list of packaged man pages\n- don't dummy up required tex stylesheets, require them\n- require pdflatex and makeindex\n\n* Thu Nov 15 2012 Nalin Dahyabhai <nalin@redhat.com>\n- update to 1.11 alpha 1\n  - drop backported patch for RT #7406\n  - drop backported patch for RT

before 3.5.10-124, which is when it\n  stopped linking with a symbol which we no longer export (#771687)\n- pull up patch for RT#7063, in which not noticing a prompt for a long\n  time throws the

a keytab to be the list of types of keys in the keytab, plus the\n  list of other types the client supports but for which it doesn't have keys,\n  in that order, so that KDCs have a better chance of being able to issue\n  tickets with session keys of types that the client can use (#837855)\n\n[1.10.3-4]\n- cut down the number of times we load SELinux labeling configuration from\n  a minimum of

upstream patch to fix freeing an uninitialized pointer and dereferencing\n  another uninitialized pointer in the KDC (MITKRB5-SA-2012-001, CVE-2012-1014\n  and CVE-2012-1015, #844779 and #844777)\n-

in the current range, in addition to the current user\n  - also package the PDF format admin, user, and install guides\n  - drop some PDFs that no longer get built right\n- add a backport of Stef's patch to set the client's list of supported\n  enctypes to match the types of keys that we have when we are using a\n  keytab to try to get initial credentials, so that a KDC won't send us\n  an AS reply that we can't encrypt (RT#2131, #748528)\n- don't shuffle around any shared libraries on releases with no-separate-/usr,\n  since /usr/lib is the same place as /lib\n- add explicit

#761317)\n  so that the default principal name can be set to that of the client for which\n  it is proxying, which results in the ccache looking more normal to consumers\n  of the ccache that don't care that there's proxying going on\n- pull in patch for RT#7047: allow tickets obtained via S4U2Proxy to be cached\n  (more of #761317)\n- pull in patch for RT#7048: allow PAC verification to only

The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but\nOpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12\nfiles from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will\nbe vulnerable to this issue.\n\nOpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),\nPKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()\nand PKCS12_newpass().\n\nWe have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7().

is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. A bug was found in runc prior to version 1.1.2 where `runc exec --cap` created processes with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2). This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in runc 1.1.2. This fix changes `runc exec --cap` behavior such that the additional capabilities granted to the process being executed (as specified via `--cap` arguments) do not include inheritable capabilities.

This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders=.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24536","epss":0.00066,"percentile":0.20599,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24536","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-24536","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.8","1.20.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.19.8","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.20.3","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0495},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-24536","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.8,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"856ae5282dfeec9e","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:8b2952eb02aac23a82803bf3e25d94ea78f3d4674d972cc7324a712ad9d54b6f","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.18.2","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.2","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-24539","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24539","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/491615","https://go.dev/issue/59720","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/MEb0UyuSMsU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1751","https://go.dev/cl/491615","https://go.dev/issue/59720","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/MEb0UyuSMsU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1751","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241129-0005/"],"description":"Angle brackets (<>) are not considered dangerous characters when inserted into CSS contexts.

Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41725","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.16022,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41725","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.6"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.19.6","date":"2023-03-11","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.038250000000000006},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-41725","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.6,= 1.20.0,= 1.20.0-rc1,= 1.20.0-rc2,= 1.20.0-rc3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.6"}}],"artifact":{"id":"856ae5282dfeec9e","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:8b2952eb02aac23a82803bf3e25d94ea78f3d4674d972cc7324a712ad9d54b6f","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.18.2","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.2","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-29400","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-29400","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/491617","https://go.dev/issue/59722","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/MEb0UyuSMsU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1753","https://go.dev/cl/491617","https://go.dev/issue/59722","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/MEb0UyuSMsU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1753","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241213-0005/"],"description":"Templates containing actions in unquoted HTML attributes (e.g. \"attr={{.}}\") executed with empty input can result in output with unexpected results when parsed due to HTML normalization rules.

Normal use of regular expressions is unaffected.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41715","epss":0.00016,"percentile":0.02801,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41715","cwe":"NVD-CWE-Other","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.18.7","1.19.2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.18.7","date":"2022-10-20","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.19.2","date":"2022-10-20","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.012000000000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-41715","versionConstraint":"< 1.18.7,>= 1.19.0, < 1.19.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.18.7"}}],"artifact":{"id":"856ae5282dfeec9e","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:8b2952eb02aac23a82803bf3e25d94ea78f3d4674d972cc7324a712ad9d54b6f","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.18.2","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.2","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-41724","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-41724","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/468125","https://go.dev/issue/58001","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1570","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://go.dev/cl/468125","https://go.dev/issue/58001","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/V0aBFqaFs_E","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1570","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09"],"description":"Large handshake records may cause panics in crypto/tls.

is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. In versions 1.2.7, 1.3.2 and 1.4.0-rc.2, an attacker can trick runc into misdirecting writes to /proc to other procfs files through the use of a racing container with shared mounts (we have also verified this attack is possible to exploit using a standard Dockerfile with docker buildx build as that also permits triggering parallel execution of containers with custom shared mounts configured). This redirect could be through symbolic links in a tmpfs or theoretically other methods such as regular bind-mounts. While similar, the mitigation applied for the related CVE, CVE-2019-19921, was fairly limited and effectively only caused runc to verify that when LSM labels are written they are actually procfs files.

While this could be used to create empty files, existing files would not be truncated. An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced. Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict this attack's scope but the exact scope of protection hasn't been analysed. This is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and Kubernetes. The issue is fixed in runc v1.1.14 and v1.2.0-rc3.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Using user namespaces restricts this attack fairly significantly such that the attacker can only create inodes in directories that the remapped root user/group has write access to. Unless the root user is remapped to an actual\nuser on the host (such as with rootless containers that don't use `/etc/sub[ug]id`), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to create inodes in world-writable directories. A strict enough SELinux or AppArmor policy could in principle also restrict the scope if a specific label is applied to the runc runtime, though neither the extent to which the standard existing policies block this attack nor what exact policies are needed to sufficiently restrict this attack have been thoroughly tested.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45310","epss":0.00021,"percentile":0.04461,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45310","cwe":"CWE-61","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-45310","cwe":"CWE-363","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.1.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-jfvp-7x6p-h2pv","versionConstraint":"<1.1.14 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.14"}}],"artifact":{"id":"d24ec3e012486da8","name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.1.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:8b2952eb02aac23a82803bf3e25d94ea78f3d4674d972cc7324a712ad9d54b6f","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:opencontainers:runc:v1.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/opencontainers/runc@v1.1.0","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.2","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:O9+X96OcDjkmmZyfaG996kV7yq8HsoU2h1XRRQcefG8=","mainModule":"github.com/tianon/gosu"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-22866","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22866","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/643735","https://go.dev/issue/71383","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/xU1ZCHUZw3k","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3447","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250221-0002/"],"description":"Due to the usage of a variable time instruction in the assembly implementation of an internal function, a small number of bits of secret scalars are leaked on the ppc64le architecture.

Users unable to upgrade should avoid using an untrusted container image.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28642","epss":0.00011,"percentile":0.00921,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28642","cwe":"CWE-281","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28642","cwe":"CWE-59","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.1.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-g2j6-57v7-gm8c","versionConstraint":"<1.1.5 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.5"}}],"artifact":{"id":"d24ec3e012486da8","name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.1.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:8b2952eb02aac23a82803bf3e25d94ea78f3d4674d972cc7324a712ad9d54b6f","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:opencontainers:runc:v1.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/opencontainers/runc@v1.1.0","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.2","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:O9+X96OcDjkmmZyfaG996kV7yq8HsoU2h1XRRQcefG8=","mainModule":"github.com/tianon/gosu"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-qw9x-cqr3-wc7r","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qw9x-cqr3-wc7r","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"runc container escape with malicious config due to /dev/console mount and related races","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-52565","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00528,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-52565","cwe":"CWE-61","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2025-52565","cwe":"CWE-363","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.2.8"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.2.8","date":"2025-11-06","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.006000000000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-52565","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-52565","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/01de9d65dc72f67b256ef03f9bfb795a2bf143b4","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/398955bccb7f20565c224a3064d331c19e422398","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/531ef794e4ecd628006a865ad334a048ee2b4b2e","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/9be1dbf4ac67d9840a043ebd2df5c68f36705d1d","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/aee7d3fe355dd02939d44155e308ea0052e0d53a","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/db19bbed5348847da433faa9d69e9f90192bfa64","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/de87203e625cd7a27141fb5f2ad00a320c69c5e8","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/ff94f9991bd32076c871ef0ad8bc1b763458e480","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-qw9x-cqr3-wc7r"],"description":"runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. Versions 1.0.0-rc3 through 1.2.7, 1.3.0-rc.1 through 1.3.2, and 1.4.0-rc.1 through 1.4.0-rc.2, due to insufficient checks when bind-mounting `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` inside the container, an attacker can trick runc into bind-mounting paths which would normally be made read-only or be masked onto a path that the attacker can write to. This attack is very similar in concept and application to CVE-2025-31133, except that it attacks a similar vulnerability in a different target (namely, the bind-mount of `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` as configured for all containers that allocate a console). This happens after `pivot_root(2)`, so this cannot be used to write to host files directly -- however, as with CVE-2025-31133, this can load to denial of service of the host or a container breakout by providing the attacker with a writable copy of `/proc/sysrq-trigger` or `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` (respectively). This issue is fixed in versions 1.2.8, 1.3.3 and 1.4.0-rc.3.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:N/VI:H/VA:N/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":8.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-52565","epss":0.00008,"percentile":0.00528,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-52565","cwe":"CWE-61","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2025-52565","cwe":"CWE-363","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.1.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-qw9x-cqr3-wc7r","versionConstraint":">=1.0.0-rc3,<=1.2.7
