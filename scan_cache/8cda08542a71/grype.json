Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45337","epss":0.42906,"percentile":0.97329,"date":"2025-11-13"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.0.0-20210817164053-32db794688a5"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v778-237x-gjrc","versionConstraint":"<0.31.0 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.31.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"0ccbfc0c5c7fc0ee","name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.0.0-20210817164053-32db794688a5","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/argocd","layerID":"sha256:f9a78a1e7a9c3ce4f13dc3a079bfe55ff89bbffd3a6a4f32ccaf78c9e4c7d3ea","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/argocd","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:go:ssh:v0.0.0-20210817164053-32db794688a5:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/crypto@v0.0.0-20210817164053-32db794688a5","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.17.6","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:HWj/xjIHfjYU5nVXpTM0s39J9CbLn7Cc5a7IC5rwsMQ=","mainModule":"github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-4v7x-pqxf-cx7m","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4v7x-pqxf-cx7m","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"net/http, x/net/http2: close connections when receiving too many headers","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45288","epss":0.64852,"percentile":0.98379,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.23.0"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"0.23.0","date":"2024-04-20","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":33.39878},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-45288","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45288","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/05/4","https://go.dev/cl/576155","https://go.dev/issue/65051","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/YgW0sx8mN3M","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QRYFHIQ6XRKRYBI2F5UESH67BJBQXUPT/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2687","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240419-0009/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/05/4","https://go.dev/cl/576155","https://go.dev/issue/65051","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/YgW0sx8mN3M","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QRYFHIQ6XRKRYBI2F5UESH67BJBQXUPT/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2687","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240419-0009/","https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/421644"],"description":"An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected

BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1n and 3.0.2 on the 15th March 2022. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.2 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1n (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1m). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zd (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zc).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-0778","epss":0.09098,"percentile":0.92308,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-0778","cwe":"CWE-835","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"21.10"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1l-1ubuntu1.1"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:21.10"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-0778","versionConstraint":"<

is a container runtime available as a daemon for Linux and Windows. A bug was found in containerd prior to versions 1.6.1, 1.5.10, and 1.14.12 where containers launched through containerd’s CRI implementation on Linux with a specially-crafted image configuration could gain access to read-only copies of arbitrary files and directories on the host. This may bypass any policy-based enforcement on container setup (including a Kubernetes Pod Security Policy) and expose potentially sensitive information. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd’s CRI implementation. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.1, 1.5.10, and 1.4.12.

A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where the data directory (typically `/var/lib/docker`) contained subdirectories with insufficiently restricted permissions, allowing otherwise unprivileged Linux users to traverse directory contents and execute programs. When containers included executable programs with extended permission bits (such as `setuid`), unprivileged Linux users could discover and execute those programs. When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host collided with the file owner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linux user on the host could discover, read, and modify those files. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.9. Users should update to this version as soon as possible. Running containers should be stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed. For users unable to upgrade limit access to the host to trusted users. Limit access to host volumes to trusted containers.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":6.3,"exploitabilityScore":2.1,"impactScore":3.8},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.6,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":6.3,"exploitabilityScore":2.1,"impactScore":3.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-41091","epss":0.04758,"percentile":0.88951,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-41091","cwe":"CWE-281","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2021-41091","cwe":"CWE-732","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3fwx-pjgw-3558","versionConstraint":"<20.10.9 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"20.10.9"}}],"artifact":{"id":"715dca0304c9c928","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/helm","layerID":"sha256:110dd3f0a788c4634e6f108ebfe0e6727ce35b73698f8697b3ddf805333a698b","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/helm","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118\\+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.10","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:iWPIG7pWIsCwT6ZtHnTUpoVMnete7O/pzd9HFE3+tn8=","mainModule":"helm.sh/helm/v3"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-cgcv-5272-97pr","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-cgcv-5272-97pr","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Kubernetes mountable secrets policy bypass","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-2728","epss":0.04348,"percentile":0.88421,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-2728","cwe":"CWE-20","source":"jordan@liggitt.net","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.24.15"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.24.15","date":"2023-07-07","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":2.5000999999999998},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-2728","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-2728","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/06/3","https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/118640","https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce/c/vPWYJ_L84m8","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230803-0004/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/06/3","https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/118640","https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce/c/vPWYJ_L84m8","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230803-0004/"],"description":"Users may be able to launch containers that bypass the mountable secrets policy enforced by the ServiceAccount admission plugin when using ephemeral containers.

is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in `dockerd` and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code.\n\nThe `overlay` network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with the VXLAN metadata, including a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the `u32` iptables extension provided by the `xt_u32` kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nAn iptables rule designates outgoing VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted overlay network for IPsec encapsulation.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks on affected platforms silently transmit unencrypted data. As a result, `overlay` networks may appear to be functional, passing traffic as expected, but without any of the expected confidentiality or data integrity guarantees.\n\nIt is possible for an attacker sitting in a trusted position on the network to read all of the application traffic that is moving across the overlay network, resulting in unexpected secrets or user data disclosure. Thus, because many database protocols, internal APIs, etc. are not protected by a second layer of encryption, a user may use Swarm encrypted overlay networks to provide confidentiality, which due to this vulnerability this is no longer guaranteed.\n\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3, and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Close the VXLAN port (by default, UDP port 4789) to outgoing traffic at the Internet boundary in order to prevent unintentionally leaking unencrypted traffic over the Internet, and/or ensure that the `xt_u32` kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28841","epss":0.02777,"percentile":0.85558,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28841","cwe":"CWE-311","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28841","cwe":"CWE-636","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28841","cwe":"CWE-311","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28841","cwe":"CWE-755","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-33pg-m6jh-5237","versionConstraint":">=1.12.0,<20.10.24 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"20.10.24"}}],"artifact":{"id":"715dca0304c9c928","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/helm","layerID":"sha256:110dd3f0a788c4634e6f108ebfe0e6727ce35b73698f8697b3ddf805333a698b","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/helm","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118\\+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.10","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:iWPIG7pWIsCwT6ZtHnTUpoVMnete7O/pzd9HFE3+tn8=","mainModule":"helm.sh/helm/v3"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-29921","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-29921","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://bugs.python.org/issue36384","https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html","https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/63298930fb531ba2bb4f23bc3b915dbf1e17e9e1/Misc/NEWS.d/3.8.0a4.rst","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/12577","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/25099","https://github.com/sickcodes","https://github.com/sickcodes/security/blob/master/advisories/SICK-2021-014.md","https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/ipaddress-ipv4-leading-zeros.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202305-02","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210622-0003/","https://sick.codes/sick-2021-014","https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html","https://bugs.python.org/issue36384","https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html","https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/63298930fb531ba2bb4f23bc3b915dbf1e17e9e1/Misc/NEWS.d/3.8.0a4.rst","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/12577","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/25099","https://github.com/sickcodes","https://github.com/sickcodes/security/blob/master/advisories/SICK-2021-014.md","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/12/msg00000.html","https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/ipaddress-ipv4-leading-zeros.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202305-02","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210622-0003/","https://sick.codes/sick-2021-014","https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"],"description":"In Python before 3,9,5, the ipaddress library mishandles leading zero characters in the octets of an IP address string.

malicious server can serve excessive amounts of `Set-Cookie:` headers in a HTTP response to curl and curl < 7.84.0 stores all of them. A sufficiently large amount of (big) cookies make subsequent HTTP requests to this, or other servers to which the cookies match, create requests that become larger than the threshold that curl uses internally to avoid sending crazy large requests (1048576 bytes) and instead returns an error.This denial state might remain for as long as the same cookies are kept, match and haven't expired. Due to cookie matching rules, a server on `foo.example.com` can set cookies that also would match for `bar.example.com`, making it it possible for a \"sister server\" to effectively cause a denial of

is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in `dockerd` and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code.\n\nThe `overlay` network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with the VXLAN metadata, including a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the `u32` iptables extension provided by the `xt_u32` kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nThe `overlay` driver dynamically and lazily defines the kernel configuration for the VXLAN network on each node as containers are attached and detached. Routes and encryption parameters are only defined for destination nodes that participate in the network. The iptables rules that prevent encrypted overlay networks from accepting unencrypted packets are not created until a peer is available with which to communicate.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks silently accept cleartext VXLAN datagrams that are tagged with the VNI of an encrypted overlay network. As a result, it is possible to inject arbitrary Ethernet frames into the encrypted overlay network by encapsulating them in VXLAN datagrams. The implications of this can be quite dire, and GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw should be referenced for a deeper exploration.\n\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3, and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\nSome workarounds are available. In multi-node clusters, deploy a global ‘pause’ container for each encrypted overlay network, on every node. For a single-node cluster, do not use overlay networks of any sort. Bridge networks provide the same connectivity on a single node and have no multi-node features. The Swarm ingress feature is implemented using an overlay network, but can be disabled by publishing ports in `host` mode instead of `ingress` mode (allowing the use of an external load balancer), and removing the `ingress` network. If encrypted overlay networks are in exclusive use, block UDP port 4789 from traffic that has not been validated by IPSec.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28842","epss":0.006,"percentile":0.68598,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28842","cwe":"CWE-420","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28842","cwe":"CWE-636","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28842","cwe":"CWE-755","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-6wrf-mxfj-pf5p","versionConstraint":">=1.12.0,<20.10.24 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"20.10.24"}}],"artifact":{"id":"715dca0304c9c928","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/helm","layerID":"sha256:110dd3f0a788c4634e6f108ebfe0e6727ce35b73698f8697b3ddf805333a698b","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/helm","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118\\+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.10","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:iWPIG7pWIsCwT6ZtHnTUpoVMnete7O/pzd9HFE3+tn8=","mainModule":"helm.sh/helm/v3"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-3733","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3733","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://bugs.python.org/issue43075","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1995234","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/7215d1ae25525c92b026166f9d5cac85fb","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/24391","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00024.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00039.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220407-0001/","https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-3733","https://bugs.python.org/issue43075","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1995234","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/7215d1ae25525c92b026166f9d5cac85fb","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/24391","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00024.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00039.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/12/msg00000.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220407-0001/","https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-3733"],"description":"There's a flaw in urllib's AbstractBasicAuthHandler class.

is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component (`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby, is commonly referred to as *Docker*.\n\nSwarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default in dockerd and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code.\n\nThe overlay network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN, which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network between nodes.\n\nEncrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through encryption.\n\nWhen setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the u32 iptables extension provided by the xt_u32 kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN.\n\nTwo iptables rules serve to filter incoming VXLAN datagrams with a VNI that corresponds to an encrypted network and discards unencrypted datagrams. The rules are appended to the end of the INPUT filter chain, following any rules that have been previously set by the system administrator. Administrator-set rules take precedence over the rules Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams, which can potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been discarded.\n\nThe injection of arbitrary Ethernet frames can enable a Denial of Service attack. A sophisticated attacker may be able to establish a UDP or TCP connection by way of the container’s outbound gateway that would otherwise be blocked by a stateful firewall, or carry out other escalations beyond simple injection by smuggling packets into the overlay network.\n\nPatches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3 and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should update to 20.10.16.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Close the VXLAN port (by default, UDP port 4789) to incoming traffic at the Internet boundary to prevent all VXLAN packet injection, and/or ensure that the `xt_u32` kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.7,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.8},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28840","epss":0.00425,"percentile":0.61485,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28840","cwe":"CWE-420","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28840","cwe":"CWE-636","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28840","cwe":"CWE-203","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28840","cwe":"CWE-755","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-232p-vwff-86mp","versionConstraint":">=1.12.0,<20.10.24

It primarily affects servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as \"not connected\" and won't initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the SSLSocket.)","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-40217","epss":0.00581,"percentile":0.68037,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.8.18","3.9.18","3.10.13","3.11.5"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.8.18","date":"2023-09-01","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"3.10.13","date":"2023-09-01","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"3.11.5","date":"2023-09-01","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"3.9.18","date":"2023-09-01","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.299215},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.8.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.8"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-40217","versionConstraint":"<

Several workarounds are available, including removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in the InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers; adding custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the request method given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or web application firewall, configured to only allow a limited set of methods.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-21698","epss":0.00279,"percentile":0.5098,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-21698","cwe":"CWE-400","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-21698","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/prometheus/client_golang","version":"v1.11.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-cg3q-j54f-5p7p","versionConstraint":"<1.11.1 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.11.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"10da0f7df516f175","name":"github.com/prometheus/client_golang","version":"v1.11.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/helm","layerID":"sha256:110dd3f0a788c4634e6f108ebfe0e6727ce35b73698f8697b3ddf805333a698b","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/helm","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:prometheus:client-golang:v1.11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:prometheus:client_golang:v1.11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/prometheus/client_golang@v1.11.0","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.10","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:HNkLOAEQMIDv/K+04rukrLx6ch7msSRwf3/SASFAGtQ=","mainModule":"helm.sh/helm/v3"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-45290","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45290","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/569341","https://go.dev/issue/65383","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2599","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0004/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/569341","https://go.dev/issue/65383","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2599","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0004/"],"description":"When parsing a multipart form (either explicitly with Request.ParseMultipartForm or implicitly with Request.FormValue, Request.PostFormValue, or Request.FormFile), limits on the total size of the parsed form were not applied to the memory consumed while reading a single form line.

is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in containerd's CRI implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the host. In the CRI stream server, a goroutine is launched to handle terminal resize events if a TTY is requested. If the user's process fails to launch due to, for example, a faulty command, the goroutine will be stuck waiting to send without a receiver, resulting in a memory leak. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd's CRI implementation and the stream server is used for handling container IO. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.12 and 1.5.16.  Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used and that only trusted users have permissions to execute commands in running containers.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.7,"exploitabilityScore":2.1,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-23471","epss":0.00291,"percentile":0.52156,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-23471","cwe":"CWE-400","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-23471","cwe":"CWE-401","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"v1.5.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-2qjp-425j-52j9","versionConstraint":"<1.5.16 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.5.16"}}],"artifact":{"id":"6f62bb33ceee8b35","name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"v1.5.7","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/helm","layerID":"sha256:110dd3f0a788c4634e6f108ebfe0e6727ce35b73698f8697b3ddf805333a698b","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/helm","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:containerd:containerd:v1.5.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/containerd/containerd@v1.5.7","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.10","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:rQyoYtj4KddB3bxG6SAqd4+08gePNyJjRqvOIfV3rkM=","mainModule":"helm.sh/helm/v3"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-4189","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4189","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4189","https://bugs.python.org/issue43285","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2036020","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/0ab152c6b5d95caa2dc1a30fa96e10258b5f188e","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00024.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00039.html","https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/ftplib-pasv.html","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4189","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221104-0004/","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-4189","https://bugs.python.org/issue43285","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2036020","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/0ab152c6b5d95caa2dc1a30fa96e10258b5f188e","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00024.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00039.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/12/msg00000.html","https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/ftplib-pasv.html","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-4189","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221104-0004/"],"description":"A flaw was found in Python, specifically in the FTP (File Transfer Protocol) client library in PASV (passive) mode.

is an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. Moby's networking implementation allows for many networks, each with their own IP address range and gateway, to be defined. This feature is frequently referred to as custom networks, as each network can have a different driver, set of parameters and thus behaviors. When creating a network, the `--internal` flag is used to designate a network as _internal_. The `internal` attribute in a docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_, and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.\n\nWhen containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique network interfaces and IP addresses. The host serves as a router for non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT to/from container IPs.\n\nContainers on an internal network may communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating with any networks the host has access to (LAN or WAN) as no default route is configured, and firewall rules are set up to drop all outgoing traffic. Communication with the gateway IP address (and thus appropriately configured host services) is possible, and the host may communicate with any container IP directly.\n\nIn addition to configuring the Linux kernel's various networking features to enable container networking, `dockerd` directly provides some services to container networks. Principal among these is serving as a resolver, enabling service discovery, and resolution of names from an upstream resolver.\n\nWhen a DNS request for a name that does not correspond to a container is received, the request is forwarded to the configured upstream resolver. This request is made from the container's network namespace: the level of access and routing of traffic is the same as if the request was made by the container itself.\n\nAs a consequence of this design, containers solely attached to an internal network will be unable to resolve names using the upstream resolver, as the container itself is unable to communicate with that nameserver. Only the names of containers also attached to the internal network are able to be resolved.\n\nMany systems run a local forwarding DNS resolver. As the host and any containers have separate loopback devices, a consequence of the design described above is that containers are unable to resolve names from the host's configured resolver, as they cannot reach these addresses on the host loopback device. To bridge this gap, and to allow containers to properly resolve names even when a local forwarding resolver is used on a loopback address, `dockerd` detects this scenario and instead forward DNS requests from the host namework namespace. The loopback resolver then forwards the requests to its configured upstream resolvers, as expected.\n\nBecause `dockerd` forwards DNS requests to the host loopback device, bypassing the container network namespace's normal routing semantics entirely, internal networks can unexpectedly forward DNS requests to an external nameserver. By registering a domain for which they control the authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will eventually be answered by their nameservers.\n\nDocker Desktop is not affected, as Docker Desktop always runs an internal resolver on a RFC 1918 address.\n\nMoby releases 26.0.0, 25.0.4, and 23.0.11 are patched to prevent forwarding any DNS requests from internal networks. As a workaround, run containers intended to be solely attached to internal networks with a custom upstream address, which will force all upstream DNS queries to be resolved from the container's network namespace.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-29018","epss":0.00222,"percentile":0.44733,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-29018","cwe":"CWE-669","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-29018","cwe":"CWE-669","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-mq39-4gv4-mvpx","versionConstraint":"<23.0.11 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"23.0.11"}}],"artifact":{"id":"715dca0304c9c928","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/helm","layerID":"sha256:110dd3f0a788c4634e6f108ebfe0e6727ce35b73698f8697b3ddf805333a698b","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/helm","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118\\+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.10","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:iWPIG7pWIsCwT6ZtHnTUpoVMnete7O/pzd9HFE3+tn8=","mainModule":"helm.sh/helm/v3"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-3996","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-3996","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:21.10","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-3996","epss":0.00241,"percentile":0.47329,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-3996","cwe":"CWE-552","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2021-3996","cwe":"CWE-552","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.36.1-8ubuntu2.2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"2.36.1-8ubuntu2.2","date":"2022-02-10","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.1205},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2021-3996","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3996","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/170176/snap-confine-must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms-Race-Condition.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Dec/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/30/2","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-3996","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2024628","https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/commit/166e87368ae88bf31112a30e078cceae637f4cdb","https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/v2.37/v2.37.3-ReleaseNotes","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-08","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221209-0002/","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/24/2","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/170176/snap-confine-must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms-Race-Condition.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Dec/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/30/2","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-3996","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2024628","https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/commit/166e87368ae88bf31112a30e078cceae637f4cdb","https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/v2.37/v2.37.3-ReleaseNotes","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202401-08","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20221209-0002/","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/24/2"],"description":"A logic error was found in the libmount library of util-linux in the function that allows an unprivileged user to unmount a FUSE filesystem.

On installations using SELinux, such as EL8 (CentOS, RHEL), Fedora, or SUSE MicroOS, with containerd since v1.5.0-beta.0 as the backing container runtime interface (CRI), an unprivileged pod scheduled to the node may bind mount, via hostPath volume, any privileged, regular file on disk for complete read/write access (sans delete). Such is achieved by placing the in-container location of the hostPath volume mount at either `/etc/hosts`, `/etc/hostname`, or `/etc/resolv.conf`. These locations are being relabeled indiscriminately to match the container process-label which effectively elevates permissions for savvy containers that would not normally be able to access privileged host files.

possible.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":6,"exploitabilityScore":6.9,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8,"exploitabilityScore":1.4,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-43816","epss":0.00147,"percentile":0.35784,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-43816","cwe":"CWE-281","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2021-43816","cwe":"CWE-281","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"v1.5.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-mvff-h3cj-wj9c","versionConstraint":">=1.5.0,<1.5.9

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.0015,"percentile":0.36138,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20201110031124-69a78807bb2b"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8","versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.0015,"percentile":0.36138,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20210520170846-37e1c6afe023"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8","versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.0015,"percentile":0.36138,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20211209124913-491a49abca63"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8","versionConstraint":"<0.17.0 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.17.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"5ed297c799bed4bc","name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20211209124913-491a49abca63","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/argocd","layerID":"sha256:f9a78a1e7a9c3ce4f13dc3a079bfe55ff89bbffd3a6a4f32ccaf78c9e4c7d3ea","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/argocd","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:networking:v0.0.0-20211209124913-491a49abca63:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/net@v0.0.0-20211209124913-491a49abca63","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.17.6","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:iocB37TsdFuN6IBRZ+ry36wrkoV51/tl5vOWqkcPGvY=","mainModule":"github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-41617","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2021-41617","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:21.10","severity":"Low","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-41617","epss":0.00372,"percentile":0.5825,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-41617","cwe":"NVD-CWE-Other","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.1116},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2021-41617","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41617","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1190975","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/12/msg00017.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6XJIONMHMKZDTMH6BQR5TNLF2WDCGWED/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KVI7RWM2JLNMWTOFK6BDUSGNOIPZYPUT/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/W44V2PFQH5YLRN6ZJTVRKAD7CU6CYYET/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211014-0004/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5586","https://www.openssh.com/security.html","https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.8","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/09/26/1","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html","https://www.starwindsoftware.com/security/sw-20220805-0001/","https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/154174","https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1190975","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/12/msg00017.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6XJIONMHMKZDTMH6BQR5TNLF2WDCGWED/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KVI7RWM2JLNMWTOFK6BDUSGNOIPZYPUT/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/W44V2PFQH5YLRN6ZJTVRKAD7CU6CYYET/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211014-0004/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5586","https://www.openssh.com/security.html","https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.8","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/09/26/1","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html","https://www.starwindsoftware.com/security/sw-20220805-0001/","https://www.tenable.com/plugins/nessus/154174"],"description":"sshd in OpenSSH 6.2 through 8.x before 8.8, when certain non-default configurations are used, allows privilege escalation because supplemental groups are not initialized as expected.

This can result in the address header being misinterpreted by some mail servers.","cvss":[{"source":"cna@python.org","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:H/AT:P/PR:L/UI:N/VC:L/VI:N/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":2.3},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-1795","epss":0.00371,"percentile":0.58194,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-1795","cwe":"CWE-116","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.11.9","3.12.3","3.13.0a5"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.11.9","date":"2025-03-04","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"3.12.3","date":"2025-03-04","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"3.13.0a5","date":"2025-03-04","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.09831500000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.8.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.8"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-1795","versionConstraint":"< 3.11.9,>= 3.12.0, < 3.12.3,>= 3.13.0a1, < 3.13.0a5 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.11.9"}}],"artifact":{"id":"0f19eb31a012b832","name":"python","version":"3.8.8","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/aws-cli/v2/current/dist/libpython3.8.so.1.0","layerID":"sha256:8e400dc77cc2a4a26e413b67824b7414aed1f80eecc4f00a0d8fb9710839d715","accessPath":"/usr/local/aws-cli/v2/current/dist/libpython3.8.so.1.0","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:3.8.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.8.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@3.8.8","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-4330","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4330","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://gist.github.com/sethmlarson/52398e33eff261329a0180ac1d54f42f","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/19de092debb3d7e832e5672cc2f7b788d35951da","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/28463dba112af719df1e8b0391c46787ad756dd9","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/3612d8f51741b11f36f8fb0494d79086bac9390a","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/4633f3f497b1ff70e4a35b6fe2c907cbe2d4cb2e","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/9c1110ef6652687d7c55f590f909720eddde965a","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/9e0ac76d96cf80b49055f6d6b9a6763fb9215c2a","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/aa9eb5f757ceff461e6e996f12c89e5d9b583b01","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/dd8f187d0746da151e0025c51680979ac5b4cfb1","https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/135034","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/135037","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/MAXIJJCUUMCL7ATZNDVEGGHUMQMUUKLG/"],"description":"Allows the extraction filter to be ignored, allowing symlink targets to point outside the destination directory, and the modification of some file metadata.\n\n\nYou are affected by this vulnerability if using the tarfile module to extract untrusted tar archives using TarFile.extractall() or TarFile.extract() using the filter= parameter with a value of \"data\" or \"tar\".

Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. Git Bash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users who installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio are vulnerable: simply creating a new project would already read and respect the config specified in `C:\\.git\\config`. Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable to upgrade may create the folder `.git` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround. Alternatively, define or extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` to cover the _parent_ directory of the user profile, e.g. `C:\\Users` if the user profile is located in

Those untrusted parties could create the folder `C:\\.git`, which would be picked up by Git operations run supposedly outside a repository while searching for a Git directory. Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. Git Bash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users who installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio are vulnerable: simply creating a new project would already read and respect the config specified in `C:\\.git\\config`. Users of the Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable to upgrade may create the folder `.git` on all drives where Git commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders as a workaround. Alternatively, define or extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` to cover the _parent_ directory of the user profile, e.g. `C:\\Users` if the user profile is located in `C:\\Users\\my-user-name`.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","metrics":{"baseScore":6.9,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":10.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":6,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24765","epss":0.00196,"percentile":0.41847,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24765","cwe":"CWE-427","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"21.10"},"package":{"name":"git","version":"1:2.32.0-1ubuntu1"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:21.10"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-24765","versionConstraint":"<

is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. A bug was found in runc prior to version 1.1.2 where `runc exec --cap` created processes with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2). This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in runc 1.1.2. This fix changes `runc exec --cap` behavior such that the additional capabilities granted to the process being executed (as specified via `--cap` arguments) do not include inheritable capabilities. In addition, `runc spec` is changed to not set any inheritable capabilities in the created example OCI spec (`config.json`) file.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.6,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-29162","epss":0.00138,"percentile":0.34371,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-29162","cwe":"CWE-276","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-f3fp-gc8g-vw66","versionConstraint":"<1.1.2

In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":6,"exploitabilityScore":6.9,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":6,"exploitabilityScore":1.8,"impactScore":3.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-43784","epss":0.00129,"percentile":0.33187,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-43784","cwe":"CWE-190","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v95c-p5hm-xq8f","versionConstraint":"<1.0.3 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.0.3"}}],"artifact":{"id":"e4607a9e00a7a243","name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.2","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/helm","layerID":"sha256:110dd3f0a788c4634e6f108ebfe0e6727ce35b73698f8697b3ddf805333a698b","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/helm","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:opencontainers:runc:v1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/opencontainers/runc@v1.0.2","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.10","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:opHZMaswlyxz1OuGpBE53Dwe4/xF7EZTY0A2L/FpCOg=","mainModule":"helm.sh/helm/v3"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-hqxw-f8mx-cpmw","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hqxw-f8mx-cpmw","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"distribution catalog API endpoint can lead to OOM via malicious user input","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-2253","epss":0.00093,"percentile":0.26827,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-2253","cwe":"CWE-475","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-2253","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.8.2-beta.1"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"2.8.2-beta.1","date":"2023-05-12","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.06974999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-2253","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-2253","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2189886","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00035.html","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2189886","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00035.html"],"description":"A flaw was found in the `/v2/_catalog` endpoint in distribution/distribution, which accepts a parameter to control the maximum number of records returned (query string: `n`).

issue was discovered in Python before 3.11.1. An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16, 3.8.16, and 3.7.16.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-45061","epss":0.00081,"percentile":0.24522,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-45061","cwe":"CWE-407","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-45061","cwe":"CWE-407","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.7.16","3.8.16","3.9.16","3.10.9","3.11.1","3.12.0a3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.7.16","date":"2024-10-02","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"3.10.9","date":"2024-10-02","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"3.11.1","date":"2024-10-02","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"3.12.0a3","date":"2024-10-02","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"3.8.16","date":"2024-10-02","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"3.9.16","date":"2024-10-02","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.06075},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.8.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.8"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-45061","versionConstraint":"< 3.7.16,>= 3.10.0a0, < 3.10.9,>= 3.11.0a0, < 3.11.1,>= 3.12.0a0, < 3.12.0a3,>= 3.8.0a0, < 3.8.16,>= 3.9.0a0, < 3.9.16 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.8.16"}}],"artifact":{"id":"0f19eb31a012b832","name":"python","version":"3.8.8","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/aws-cli/v2/current/dist/libpython3.8.so.1.0","layerID":"sha256:8e400dc77cc2a4a26e413b67824b7414aed1f80eecc4f00a0d8fb9710839d715","accessPath":"/usr/local/aws-cli/v2/current/dist/libpython3.8.so.1.0","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python_software_foundation:python:3.8.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.8.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/python@3.8.8","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-50602","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-50602","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/pull/915","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/04/msg00040.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250404-0008/"],"description":"An issue was discovered in libexpat before 2.6.4.

See the tarfile  extraction filters documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile-extraction-filter  for more information. Only Python versions 3.12 or later are affected by these vulnerabilities, earlier versions don't include the extraction filter feature.\n\nNote that for Python 3.14 or later the default value of filter= changed from \"no filtering\" to `\"data\", so if you are relying on this new default behavior then your usage is also affected.\n\nNote that none of these vulnerabilities significantly affect the installation of source distributions which are tar archives as source distributions already allow arbitrary code execution during the build process.

is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and accelerate software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where containers were incorrectly started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted. This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped, deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset. This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a workaround, the entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like `capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary process starting.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":4.6,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24769","epss":0.00086,"percentile":0.25606,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-24769","cwe":"CWE-732","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-24769","cwe":"CWE-732","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-2mm7-x5h6-5pvq","versionConstraint":"<20.10.14 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"20.10.14"}}],"artifact":{"id":"715dca0304c9c928","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/helm","layerID":"sha256:110dd3f0a788c4634e6f108ebfe0e6727ce35b73698f8697b3ddf805333a698b","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/helm","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118\\+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v17.12.0-ce-rc1.0.20200618181300-9dc6525e6118%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.10","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:iWPIG7pWIsCwT6ZtHnTUpoVMnete7O/pzd9HFE3+tn8=","mainModule":"helm.sh/helm/v3"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-39323","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39323","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/533215","https://go.dev/issue/63211","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/XBa1oHDevAo","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CLB4TW7KALB3EEQWNWCN7OUIWWVWWCG2/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KSEGD2IWKNUO3DWY4KQGUQM5BISRWHQE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XFOIBB4YFICHDM7IBOP7PWXW3FX4HLL2/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2095","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231020-0001/","https://go.dev/cl/533215","https://go.dev/issue/63211","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/XBa1oHDevAo","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/CLB4TW7KALB3EEQWNWCN7OUIWWVWWCG2/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/KSEGD2IWKNUO3DWY4KQGUQM5BISRWHQE/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/XFOIBB4YFICHDM7IBOP7PWXW3FX4HLL2/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-2095","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231020-0001/"],"description":"Line directives (\"//line\") can be used to bypass the restrictions on \"//go:cgo_\" directives, allowing blocked linker and compiler flags to be passed during compilation.

is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization. The classic builder cache system is prone to cache poisoning if the image is built FROM scratch. Also, changes to some instructions (most important being HEALTHCHECK and ONBUILD) would not cause a cache miss. An attacker with the knowledge of the Dockerfile someone is using could poison their cache by making them pull a specially crafted image that would be considered as a valid cache candidate for some build steps. 23.0+ users are only affected if they explicitly opted out of Buildkit (DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 environment variable) or are using the /build API endpoint. All users on versions older than 23.0 could be impacted. Image build API endpoint (/build) and ImageBuild function from github.com/docker/docker/client is also affected as it the uses classic builder by default.

The chunk reader now produces an error if the ratio of real body to encoded bytes grows too small.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39326","epss":0.00048,"percentile":0.14663,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.20.12","1.21.5"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.20.12","date":"2023-12-13","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.21.5","date":"2023-12-13","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.02472},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.17.6:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.17.6"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-39326","versionConstraint":"< 1.20.12,>= 1.21.0-0, < 1.21.5 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.20.12"}}],"artifact":{"id":"7cdf30c7dfaa8b3b","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.17.6","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/argocd","layerID":"sha256:f9a78a1e7a9c3ce4f13dc3a079bfe55ff89bbffd3a6a4f32ccaf78c9e4c7d3ea","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/argocd","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.17.6:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.17.6","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.17.6","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-2880","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2880","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/432976","https://go.dev/issue/54663","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/xtuG5faxtaU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-1038","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://go.dev/cl/432976","https://go.dev/issue/54663","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/xtuG5faxtaU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-1038","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09"],"description":"Requests forwarded by ReverseProxy include the raw query parameters from the inbound request, including unparsable parameters rejected by net/http.

3.9.x before 3.9.16 and 3.10.x before 3.10.9 on Linux allows local privilege escalation in a non-default configuration. The Python multiprocessing library, when used with the forkserver start method on Linux, allows pickles to be deserialized from any user in the same machine local network namespace, which in many system configurations means any user on the same machine. Pickles can execute arbitrary code. Thus, this allows for local user privilege escalation to the user that any forkserver process is running as. Setting multiprocessing.util.abstract_sockets_supported to False is a workaround. The forkserver start method for multiprocessing is not the default start method. This issue is Linux specific because only Linux supports abstract namespace sockets. CPython before 3.9 does not make use of Linux abstract namespace sockets by default. Support for users manually specifying an abstract namespace socket was added as a bugfix in 3.7.8 and 3.8.3, but users would need to make specific uncommon API calls in order to do that in CPython before 3.9.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-42919","epss":0.00024,"percentile":0.05314,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-42919","cwe":"CWE-502","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.9.16","3.10.9"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.10.9","date":"2023-02-07","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"3.9.16","date":"2023-02-07","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.01836},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python:python:3.8.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.8"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-42919","versionConstraint":">=

is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where supplementary groups are not set up properly. If an attacker has direct access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access, they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container.  This bug is fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.18. Running containers should be stopped and restarted for the permissions to be fixed.

A bug was found in containerd prior to versions 1.6.18 and 1.5.18 where supplementary groups are not set up properly inside a container. If an attacker has direct access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group access, they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in that container. Downstream applications that use the containerd client library may be affected as well.\n\nThis bug has been fixed in containerd v1.6.18 and v.1.5.18. Users should update to these versions and recreate containers to resolve this issue. Users who rely on a downstream application that uses containerd's client library should check that application for a separate advisory and instructions. As a workaround, ensure that the `\"USER $USERNAME\"` Dockerfile instruction is not used. Instead, set the container entrypoint to a value similar to `ENTRYPOINT [\"su\", \"-\", \"user\"]` to allow `su` to properly set up supplementary groups.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-25173","epss":0.00022,"percentile":0.0476,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-25173","cwe":"CWE-863","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-25173","cwe":"CWE-863","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"v1.5.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-hmfx-3pcx-653p","versionConstraint":"<1.5.18 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.5.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"6f62bb33ceee8b35","name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"v1.5.7","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/helm","layerID":"sha256:110dd3f0a788c4634e6f108ebfe0e6727ce35b73698f8697b3ddf805333a698b","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/helm","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:containerd:containerd:v1.5.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/containerd/containerd@v1.5.7","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.10","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:rQyoYtj4KddB3bxG6SAqd4+08gePNyJjRqvOIfV3rkM=","mainModule":"helm.sh/helm/v3"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-4516","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-4516","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/4398b788ffc1f954a2c552da285477d42a571292","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/6279eb8c076d89d3739a6edb393e43c7929b429d","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/69b4387f78f413e8c47572a85b3478c47eba8142","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/73b3040f592436385007918887b7e2132aa8431f","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/8d35fd1b34935221aff23a1ab69a429dd156be77","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/9f69a58623bd01349a18ba0c7a9cb1dad6a51e8e","https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/ab9893c40609935e0d40a6d2a7307ea51aec598b","https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/133767","https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/129648","https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/L75IPBBTSCYEF56I2M4KIW353BB3AY74/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/05/16/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/05/19/1"],"description":"There is an issue in CPython when using `bytes.decode(\"unicode_escape\", error=\"ignore|replace\")`.

is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification. In versions 1.2.7, 1.3.2 and 1.4.0-rc.2, an attacker can trick runc into misdirecting writes to /proc to other procfs files through the use of a racing container with shared mounts (we have also verified this attack is possible to exploit using a standard Dockerfile with docker buildx build as that also permits triggering parallel execution of containers with custom shared mounts configured). This redirect could be through symbolic links in a tmpfs or theoretically other methods such as regular bind-mounts. While similar, the mitigation applied for the related CVE, CVE-2019-19921, was fairly limited and effectively only caused runc to verify that when LSM labels are written they are actually procfs files.

While this could be used to create empty files, existing files would not be truncated. An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced. Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict this attack's scope but the exact scope of protection hasn't been analysed. This is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and Kubernetes. The issue is fixed in runc v1.1.14 and v1.2.0-rc3.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Using user namespaces restricts this attack fairly significantly such that the attacker can only create inodes in directories that the remapped root user/group has write access to. Unless the root user is remapped to an actual\nuser on the host (such as with rootless containers that don't use `/etc/sub[ug]id`), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to create inodes in world-writable directories. A strict enough SELinux or AppArmor policy could in principle also restrict the scope if a specific label is applied to the runc runtime, though neither the extent to which the standard existing policies block this attack nor what exact policies are needed to sufficiently restrict this attack have been thoroughly tested.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45310","epss":0.00021,"percentile":0.04461,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45310","cwe":"CWE-61","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-45310","cwe":"CWE-363","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-jfvp-7x6p-h2pv","versionConstraint":"<1.1.14 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.14"}}],"artifact":{"id":"e4607a9e00a7a243","name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.2","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/helm","layerID":"sha256:110dd3f0a788c4634e6f108ebfe0e6727ce35b73698f8697b3ddf805333a698b","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/helm","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:opencontainers:runc:v1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/opencontainers/runc@v1.0.2","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.10","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:opHZMaswlyxz1OuGpBE53Dwe4/xF7EZTY0A2L/FpCOg=","mainModule":"helm.sh/helm/v3"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-v994-f8vw-g7j4","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v994-f8vw-g7j4","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"`docker cp` allows unexpected chmod of host files in Moby Docker Engine","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.2,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-41089","epss":0.00031,"percentile":0.07827,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-41089","cwe":"CWE-281","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2021-41089","cwe":"CWE-281","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["20.10.9"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"20.10.9","date":"2024-06-11","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.00899},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2021-41089","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41089","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-222547.pdf","https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/bce32e5c93be4caf1a592582155b9cb837fc129a","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-v994-f8vw-g7j4","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/B5Q6G6I4W5COQE25QMC7FJY3I3PAYFBB/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZNFADTCHHYWVM6W4NJ6CB4FNFM2VMBIB/","https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-222547.pdf","https://github.com/moby/moby/commit/bce32e5c93be4caf1a592582155b9cb837fc129a","https://github.com/moby/moby/security/advisories/GHSA-v994-f8vw-g7j4","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/B5Q6G6I4W5COQE25QMC7FJY3I3PAYFBB/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/ZNFADTCHHYWVM6W4NJ6CB4FNFM2VMBIB/"],"description":"Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization.

Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in \"dangerous\" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience). This fix is part of the 4.5.1 release. We are aware that this changes the behaviour of an established function and is not 100 % backwards compatible, so updating to 4.5.1 might break your code.

This issue is fixed in versions 1.2.8, 1.3.3 and 1.4.0-rc.3.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:L/AC:L/AT:P/PR:L/UI:A/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H/SC:H/SI:H/SA:H/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":7.3},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-31133","epss":0.00009,"percentile":0.00662,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-31133","cwe":"CWE-61","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2025-31133","cwe":"CWE-363","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-9493-h29p-rfm2","versionConstraint":"<=1.2.7 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.2.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"e4607a9e00a7a243","name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.2","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/helm","layerID":"sha256:110dd3f0a788c4634e6f108ebfe0e6727ce35b73698f8697b3ddf805333a698b","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/helm","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:opencontainers:runc:v1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/opencontainers/runc@v1.0.2","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.10","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:opHZMaswlyxz1OuGpBE53Dwe4/xF7EZTY0A2L/FpCOg=","mainModule":"helm.sh/helm/v3"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-g2j6-57v7-gm8c","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g2j6-57v7-gm8c","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"runc AppArmor bypass with symlinked /proc","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":6.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28642","epss":0.00011,"percentile":0.00921,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-28642","cwe":"CWE-281","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-28642","cwe":"CWE-59","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.1.5"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.1.5","date":"2023-03-31","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.006104999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-28642","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-28642","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/3785","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-g2j6-57v7-gm8c","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/3785","https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-g2j6-57v7-gm8c","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241206-0005/"],"description":"runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the OCI specification.

This attack is very similar in concept and application to CVE-2025-31133, except that it attacks a similar vulnerability in a different target (namely, the bind-mount of `/dev/pts/$n` to `/dev/console` as configured for all containers that allocate a console). This happens after `pivot_root(2)`, so this cannot be used to write to host files directly -- however, as with CVE-2025-31133, this can load to denial of service of the host or a container breakout by providing the attacker with a writable copy of `/proc/sysrq-trigger` or `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` (respectively).

This could cause unexpected behavior for environments that require containers to run as a non-root user. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.38, 1.7.27, and 2.04.

This issue is fixed in versions 1.7.29, 2.0.7, 2.1.5 and 2.2.0. Workarounds include updating system administrator permissions so the host can manually chmod the directories to not have group or world accessible permissions, or to run containerd in rootless mode.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.4,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-25621","epss":0.00004,"percentile":0.0016,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-25621","cwe":"CWE-279","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/containerd/containerd","version":"v1.5.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-pwhc-rpq9-4c8w","versionConstraint":"<1.7.29

is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker Engine, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. A firewalld vulnerability affects Moby releases before 28.0.0. When firewalld reloads, Docker fails to re-create iptables rules that isolate bridge networks, allowing any container to access all ports on any other container across different bridge networks on the same host. This breaks network segmentation between containers that should be isolated, creating significant risk in multi-tenant environments. Only containers in --internal networks remain protected.\nWorkarounds include reloading firewalld and either restarting the docker daemon, re-creating bridge networks, or using rootless mode.
