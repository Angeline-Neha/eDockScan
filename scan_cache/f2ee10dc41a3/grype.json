The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the Rust standard library prior to version 1.77.2 did not properly escape arguments when invoking batch files (with the `bat` and `cmd` extensions) on Windows using the `Command`. An attacker able to control the arguments passed to the spawned process could execute arbitrary shell commands by bypassing the escaping. The severity of this vulnerability is critical for those who invoke batch files on Windows with untrusted arguments. No other platform or use is affected.\n\nThe `Command::arg` and `Command::args` APIs state in their documentation that the arguments will be passed to the spawned process as-is, regardless of the content of the arguments, and will not be evaluated by a shell. This means it should be safe to pass untrusted input as an argument.\n\nOn Windows, the implementation of this is more complex than other platforms, because the Windows API only provides a single string containing all the arguments to the spawned process, and it's up to the spawned process to split them. Most programs use the standard C run-time argv, which in practice results in a mostly consistent way arguments are splitted.\n\nOne exception though is `cmd.exe` (used among other things to execute batch files), which has its own argument splitting logic. That forces the standard library to implement custom escaping for arguments passed to batch files. Unfortunately it was reported that our escaping logic was not thorough enough, and it was possible to pass malicious arguments that would result in arbitrary shell execution.\n\nDue to the complexity of `cmd.exe`, we didn't identify a solution that would correctly escape arguments in all cases. To maintain our API guarantees, we improved the robustness of the escaping code, and changed the `Command` API to return an `InvalidInput` error when it cannot safely escape an argument. This error will be emitted when spawning the process.\n\nThe fix is included in Rust 1.77.2. Note that the new escaping logic for batch files errs on the conservative side, and could reject valid arguments. Those who implement the escaping themselves or only handle trusted inputs on Windows can also use the `CommandExt::raw_arg` method to bypass the standard library's escaping logic.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":10,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-24576","epss":0.83876,"percentile":0.99244,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-24576","cwe":"CWE-78","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-24576","cwe":"CWE-88","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.77.2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.77.2","date":"2024-04-12","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":79.6822},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:rust-lang:rust:1.76.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"rust","version":"1.76.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-24576","versionConstraint":"< 1.77.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:rust-lang:rust:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.77.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"459feca84a27b4b1","name":"rust","version":"1.76.0","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/rustup/toolchains/1.76.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/lib/libstd-98f4280c64a1a599.so","layerID":"sha256:a2528069116ad77a0418a36d4c16da906e16956d401b491c9ae87ffbcb212a28","accessPath":"/usr/local/rustup/toolchains/1.76.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/lib/libstd-98f4280c64a1a599.so","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/local/rustup/toolchains/1.76.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/lib/libstd-98f4280c64a1a599.so","layerID":"sha256:a2528069116ad77a0418a36d4c16da906e16956d401b491c9ae87ffbcb212a28","accessPath":"/usr/local/rustup/toolchains/1.76.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/lib/libstd-98f4280c64a1a599.so","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:rust-lang:rust:1.76.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/rust@1.76.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-6119","dataSource":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2024-6119","namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.19","severity":"High","urls":[],"cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-6119","epss":0.15242,"percentile":0.94326,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-6119","cwe":"CWE-843","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-6119","cwe":"CWE-843","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.1.7-r0"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.1.7-r0","date":"2024-09-05","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":11.4315},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-6119","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-6119","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/05f360d9e849a1b277db628f1f13083a7f8dd04f","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/06d1dc3fa96a2ba5a3e22735a033012aadc9f0d6","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/621f3729831b05ee828a3203eddb621d014ff2b2","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/7dfcee2cd2a63b2c64b9b4b0850be64cb695b0a0","https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20240903.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/09/03/4","https://lists.freebsd.org/archives/freebsd-security/2024-September/000303.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240912-0001/"],"description":"Issue summary: Applications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS\nclients checking server certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory\naddress resulting in abnormal termination of the application process.\n\nImpact summary: Abnormal termination of an application can a cause a denial of\nservice.\n\nApplications performing certificate name checks (e.g., TLS clients checking\nserver certificates) may attempt to read an invalid memory address when\ncomparing the expected name with an `otherName` subject alternative name of an\nX.509 certificate.

summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an\nempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to\nbe sent to the peer.\n\nImpact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences\nsuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they\nbecome available.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","epss":0.05822,"percentile":0.90122,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"apk-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"alpine","version":"3.19.1"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.1.4-r5"},"namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.19"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-5535","versionConstraint":"<

summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an\nempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to\nbe sent to the peer.\n\nImpact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences\nsuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used.

Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer\nis still in use.\n\nWhile these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a\nmalicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.\nWe are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4741","epss":0.00238,"percentile":0.46852,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4741","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"apk-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"alpine","version":"3.19.1"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.1.4-r5"},"namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.19"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-4741","versionConstraint":"< 3.1.6-r0 (apk)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.1.6-r0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"1aad1bf56e279910","name":"libssl3","version":"3.1.4-r5","type":"apk","locations":[{"path":"/lib/apk/db/installed","layerID":"sha256:7d3ceee45f4ade6ae1cb02458e9b4f815bcab595403b023bdee19b9ff7ee5141","accessPath":"/lib/apk/db/installed","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssl3:libssl3:3.1.4-r5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl3:libssl:3.1.4-r5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl:libssl3:3.1.4-r5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl:libssl:3.1.4-r5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libssl3@3.1.4-r5?arch=x86_64&distro=alpine-3.19.1&upstream=openssl","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl"}],"metadataType":"ApkMetadata","metadata":{"files":[{"path":"/lib"},{"path":"/lib/libssl.so.3"},{"path":"/usr"},{"path":"/usr/lib"},{"path":"/usr/lib/libssl.so.3"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-13176","dataSource":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2024-13176","namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.19","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.1,"exploitabilityScore":0.7,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-13176","epss":0.00115,"percentile":0.30862,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-13176","cwe":"CWE-385","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.1.8-r0"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.1.8-r0","date":"2025-02-12","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.052324999999999997},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-13176","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-13176","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/07272b05b04836a762b4baa874958af51d513844","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/2af62e74fb59bc469506bc37eb2990ea408d9467","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/392dcb336405a0c94486aa6655057f59fd3a0902","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4b1cb94a734a7d4ec363ac0a215a25c181e11f65","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/77c608f4c8857e63e98e66444e2e761c9627916f","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/0d5fd1ab987f7571e2c955d8d8b638fc0fb54ded","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/a2639000db19878d5d89586ae7b725080592ae86","https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20250120.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/01/20/2","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/05/msg00028.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250124-0005/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250418-0010/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250502-0006/"],"description":"Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow recovering\nthe private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.\n\nImpact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations\ncould allow recovering the private key by an attacker.

summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very\nslow.\n\nImpact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP_PKEY_param_check()\nor EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may\nexperience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked\nhave been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of\nService.\n\nThe functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform\nvarious checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time\nif the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.\n\nTrying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using\npublic keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature\nverification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit\nthe modulus size when performing the checks.\n\nAn application that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()\nand supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be\nvulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThese functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so\nonly applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications\nwhen using the `-check` option.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4603","epss":0.00092,"percentile":0.2655,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4603","cwe":"CWE-606","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-4603","cwe":"CWE-834","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"apk-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"alpine","version":"3.19.1"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.1.4-r5"},"namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.19"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-4603","versionConstraint":"< 3.1.5-r0 (apk)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.1.5-r0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"1aad1bf56e279910","name":"libssl3","version":"3.1.4-r5","type":"apk","locations":[{"path":"/lib/apk/db/installed","layerID":"sha256:7d3ceee45f4ade6ae1cb02458e9b4f815bcab595403b023bdee19b9ff7ee5141","accessPath":"/lib/apk/db/installed","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssl3:libssl3:3.1.4-r5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl3:libssl:3.1.4-r5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl:libssl3:3.1.4-r5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl:libssl:3.1.4-r5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libssl3@3.1.4-r5?arch=x86_64&distro=alpine-3.19.1&upstream=openssl","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl"}],"metadataType":"ApkMetadata","metadata":{"files":[{"path":"/lib"},{"path":"/lib/libssl.so.3"},{"path":"/usr"},{"path":"/usr/lib"},{"path":"/usr/lib/libssl.so.3"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-9230","dataSource":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2025-9230","namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.19","severity":"High","urls":[],"cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-9230","epss":0.00034,"percentile":0.09274,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-9230","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2025-9230","cwe":"CWE-787","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.1.8-r1"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.1.8-r1","date":"2025-10-02","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.025500000000000002},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-9230","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-9230","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/5965ea5dd6960f36d8b7f74f8eac67a8eb8f2b45","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/9e91358f365dee6c446dcdcdb01c04d2743fd280","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/a79c4ce559c6a3a8fd4109e9f33c1185d5bf2def","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/b5282d677551afda7d20e9c00e09561b547b2dfd","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/bae259a211ada6315dc50900686daaaaaa55f482","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/c2b96348bfa662f25f4fabf81958ae822063dae3","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/dfbaf161d8dafc1132dd88cd48ad990ed9b4c8ba","https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20250930.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/09/30/5","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/10/msg00001.html"],"description":"Issue summary: An application trying to decrypt CMS messages encrypted using\npassword based encryption can trigger an out-of-bounds read and write.\n\nImpact summary: This out-of-bounds read may trigger a crash which leads to\nDenial of Service for an application.

summary: An application using the OpenSSL HTTP client API functions may\ntrigger an out-of-bounds read if the 'no_proxy' environment variable is set and\nthe host portion of the authority component of the HTTP URL is an IPv6 address.\n\nImpact summary: An out-of-bounds read can trigger a crash which leads to\nDenial of Service for an application.\n\nThe OpenSSL HTTP client API functions can be used
