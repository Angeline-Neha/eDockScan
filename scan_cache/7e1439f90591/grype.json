One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-50387","epss":0.39615,"percentile":0.97132,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-50387","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-50387","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"10"},"package":{"name":"systemd","version":"241-7~deb10u10"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-50387","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"4a3af1af10acc0c8","name":"libudev1","version":"241-7~deb10u10","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:8a84050e401db52e8497f209ecfcf750d083895608f020cf3f25daaf65837d55","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libudev1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:8a84050e401db52e8497f209ecfcf750d083895608f020cf3f25daaf65837d55","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libudev1/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libudev1:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:8a84050e401db52e8497f209ecfcf750d083895608f020cf3f25daaf65837d55","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libudev1:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["CC0-1.0","Expat","GPL-2","GPL-2+","LGPL-2.1","LGPL-2.1+","public-domain"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libudev1:libudev1:241-7\\~deb10u10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libudev1@241-7~deb10u10?arch=amd64&distro=debian-10&upstream=systemd","upstreams":[{"name":"systemd"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2019-18276","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-18276","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10","severity":"Negligible","urls":[],"description":"An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through 5.0 patch 11.

itself.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"arm-security@arm.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4039","epss":0.00181,"percentile":0.40055,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4039","cwe":"CWE-693","source":"arm-security@arm.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-4039","cwe":"NVD-CWE-Other","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"10"},"package":{"name":"gcc-8","version":"8.3.0-6"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-4039","versionConstraint":"none

Although it is not possible to exploit this directly (e.g., adding a new user fails because \\n is in the block list), it is possible to misrepresent the /etc/passwd file when viewed. Use of \\r manipulations and Unicode characters to work around blocking of the : character make it possible to give the impression that a new user has been added. In other words, an adversary may be able to convince a system administrator to take the system offline (an indirect, social-engineered denial of service) by demonstrating that \"cat /etc/passwd\" shows a rogue user account.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-29383","epss":0.00025,"percentile":0.05719,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-29383","cwe":"CWE-74","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-29383","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"10"},"package":{"name":"shadow","version":"1:4.5-1.1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-29383","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"8b4ea518599f59aa","name":"passwd","version":"1:4.5-1.1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:8a84050e401db52e8497f209ecfcf750d083895608f020cf3f25daaf65837d55","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/passwd/copyright","layerID":"sha256:8a84050e401db52e8497f209ecfcf750d083895608f020cf3f25daaf65837d55","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/passwd/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:8a84050e401db52e8497f209ecfcf750d083895608f020cf3f25daaf65837d55","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:8a84050e401db52e8497f209ecfcf750d083895608f020cf3f25daaf65837d55","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.list","layerID":"sha256:8a84050e401db52e8497f209ecfcf750d083895608f020cf3f25daaf65837d55","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.postinst","layerID":"sha256:8a84050e401db52e8497f209ecfcf750d083895608f020cf3f25daaf65837d55","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.postinst"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.preinst","layerID":"sha256:8a84050e401db52e8497f209ecfcf750d083895608f020cf3f25daaf65837d55","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.preinst"}],"language":"","licenses":["GPL-2"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:passwd:passwd:1\\:4.5-1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/passwd@1%3A4.5-1.1?arch=amd64&distro=debian-10&upstream=shadow","upstreams":[{"name":"shadow"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2019-20386","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-20386","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10","severity":"Negligible","urls":[],"description":"An issue was discovered in button_open in login/logind-button.c in systemd before 243.
