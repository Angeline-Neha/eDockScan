attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames. Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45288","epss":0.64852,"percentile":0.98379,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.21.9","1.22.2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.21.9","date":"2024-04-06","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.22.2","date":"2024-04-06","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":48.638999999999996},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.21.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.21.3"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45288","versionConstraint":"< 1.21.9,>= 1.22.0-0, < 1.22.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.21.9"}}],"artifact":{"id":"93285028633e6074","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.21.3","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/promtail","layerID":"sha256:20a8cab59267bdb4d9646a3f1b80c2313f214789f55ea197f21d392dc655cc12","accessPath":"/usr/bin/promtail","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.21.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.21.3","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.3","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-v778-237x-gjrc","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v778-237x-gjrc","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Critical","urls":[],"description":"Misuse of ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback may cause authorization bypass in golang.org/x/crypto","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45337","epss":0.42906,"percentile":0.97329,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.31.0"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"0.31.0","date":"2024-12-12","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":38.829930000000004},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-45337","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45337","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://github.com/golang/crypto/commit/b4f1988a35dee11ec3e05d6bf3e90b695fbd8909","https://go.dev/cl/635315","https://go.dev/issue/70779","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/-nPEi39gI4Q/m/cGVPJCqdAQAJ","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-3321","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/12/11/2","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250131-0007/"],"description":"Applications and libraries which misuse connection.serverAuthenticate (via callback field ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback) may be susceptible to an authorization bypass. The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45337","epss":0.42906,"percentile":0.97329,"date":"2025-11-13"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.14.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v778-237x-gjrc","versionConstraint":"<0.31.0 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.31.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"c8d9f0ab2372d248","name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.14.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/promtail","layerID":"sha256:20a8cab59267bdb4d9646a3f1b80c2313f214789f55ea197f21d392dc655cc12","accessPath":"/usr/bin/promtail","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:go:ssh:v0.14.0:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/crypto@v0.14.0","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.3","architecture":"amd64","mainModule":"github.com/grafana/loki"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-50868","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-50868","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"The Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol (in RFC 5155 when RFC 9276 guidance is skipped) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption for SHA-1 computations) via DNSSEC responses in a random subdomain attack, aka the \"NSEC3\" issue.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to be sent to the peer.  Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling application.  The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports that there was no overlap in the lists).  This function is typically called from a server side application callback for ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\" response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it will be vulnerable to this problem.  In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of confidentiality will occur.  This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error. Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active exploitation unlikely.  The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.  Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they become available.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","epss":0.05822,"percentile":0.90122,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.1.1w-0+deb11u2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.1.1w-0+deb11u2","date":"2024-11-27","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":5.26891},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-5535","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5535","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4ada436a1946cbb24db5ab4ca082b69c1bc10f37","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/99fb785a5f85315b95288921a321a935ea29a51e","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/cf6f91f6121f4db167405db2f0de410a456f260c","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e86ac436f0bd54d4517745483e2315650fae7b2c","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/9947251413065a05189a63c9b7a6c1d4e224c21c","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/b78ec0824da857223486660177d3b1f255c65d87","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240627.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/27/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/28/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/08/15/1","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4ada436a1946cbb24db5ab4ca082b69c1bc10f37","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/99fb785a5f85315b95288921a321a935ea29a51e","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/cf6f91f6121f4db167405db2f0de410a456f260c","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e86ac436f0bd54d4517745483e2315650fae7b2c","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/9947251413065a05189a63c9b7a6c1d4e224c21c","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/b78ec0824da857223486660177d3b1f255c65d87","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/10/msg00033.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00000.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240712-0005/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241025-0006/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241025-0010/","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240627.txt"],"description":"Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an\nempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to\nbe sent to the peer.\n\nImpact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences\nsuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash.

In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they\nbecome available.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","epss":0.05822,"percentile":0.90122,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1w-0+deb11u1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-5535","versionConstraint":"< 1.1.1w-0+deb11u2 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.1w-0+deb11u2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"199983e947119477","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1w-0+deb11u1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:1a58fc2f70c1d0cf50ef4632df1b1b0c96e862625fc85ab9f55d998a4ce68f43","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","layerID":"sha256:2cb58621b2c67ac6814bdbe73d9dcd2ac67899906eab8fef70724ca096f2dca4","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:2cb58621b2c67ac6814bdbe73d9dcd2ac67899906eab8fef70724ca096f2dca4","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:2cb58621b2c67ac6814bdbe73d9dcd2ac67899906eab8fef70724ca096f2dca4","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list","layerID":"sha256:2cb58621b2c67ac6814bdbe73d9dcd2ac67899906eab8fef70724ca096f2dca4","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst","layerID":"sha256:2cb58621b2c67ac6814bdbe73d9dcd2ac67899906eab8fef70724ca096f2dca4","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst"}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1w-0\\+deb11u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openssl@1.1.1w-0%2Bdeb11u1?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-28085","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-28085","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"wall in util-linux through 2.40, often installed with setgid tty permissions, allows escape sequences to be sent to other users' terminals through argv.

is an open-source project created by Docker for software containerization. A security vulnerability has been detected in certain versions of Docker Engine, which could allow an attacker to bypass authorization plugins (AuthZ) under specific circumstances. The base likelihood of this being exploited is low.\n\nUsing a specially-crafted API request, an Engine API client could make the daemon forward the request or response to an authorization plugin without the body. In certain circumstances, the authorization plugin may allow a request which it would have otherwise denied if the body had been forwarded to it.\n\nA security issue was discovered In 2018, where an attacker could bypass AuthZ plugins using a specially crafted API request. This could lead to unauthorized actions, including privilege escalation. Although this issue was fixed in Docker Engine v18.09.1 in January 2019, the fix was not carried forward to later major versions, resulting in a regression. Anyone who depends on authorization plugins that introspect the request and/or response body to make access control decisions is potentially impacted.\n\nDocker EE v19.03.x and all versions of Mirantis Container Runtime are not vulnerable.\n\ndocker-ce v27.1.1 containes patches to fix the vulnerability. Patches have also been merged into the master, 19.03, 20.0, 23.0, 24.0, 25.0, 26.0, and 26.1 release branches. If one is unable to upgrade immediately, avoid using AuthZ plugins and/or restrict access to the Docker API to trusted parties, following the principle of least privilege.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.9,"exploitabilityScore":3.2,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-41110","epss":0.02258,"percentile":0.84076,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-41110","cwe":"CWE-187","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-41110","cwe":"CWE-444","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-41110","cwe":"CWE-863","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v23.0.3+incompatible"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v23v-6jw2-98fq","versionConstraint":">=19.03.0,<23.0.15 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"23.0.15"}}],"artifact":{"id":"1673dfa9308905b2","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v23.0.3+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/promtail","layerID":"sha256:20a8cab59267bdb4d9646a3f1b80c2313f214789f55ea197f21d392dc655cc12","accessPath":"/usr/bin/promtail","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v23.0.3\\+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v23.0.3%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.3","architecture":"amd64","mainModule":"github.com/grafana/loki"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-2511","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-2511","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause unbounded memory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions  Impact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to trigger unbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service  This problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option is being used (but not if early_data support is also configured and the default anti-replay protection is in use).

summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads or writes.  Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only \"named curves\" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable application is low.  In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates, so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509 certificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an \"exotic\" curve encoding.  The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(), and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.  Applications working with \"exotic\" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters, that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a result of reading or writing outside of array bounds.

Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer\nis still in use.\n\nWhile these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a\nmalicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.\nWe are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4741","epss":0.00238,"percentile":0.46852,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4741","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1w-0+deb11u1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-4741","versionConstraint":"< 1.1.1w-0+deb11u2 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.1w-0+deb11u2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"199983e947119477","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1w-0+deb11u1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:1a58fc2f70c1d0cf50ef4632df1b1b0c96e862625fc85ab9f55d998a4ce68f43","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","layerID":"sha256:2cb58621b2c67ac6814bdbe73d9dcd2ac67899906eab8fef70724ca096f2dca4","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:2cb58621b2c67ac6814bdbe73d9dcd2ac67899906eab8fef70724ca096f2dca4","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:2cb58621b2c67ac6814bdbe73d9dcd2ac67899906eab8fef70724ca096f2dca4","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list","layerID":"sha256:2cb58621b2c67ac6814bdbe73d9dcd2ac67899906eab8fef70724ca096f2dca4","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst","layerID":"sha256:2cb58621b2c67ac6814bdbe73d9dcd2ac67899906eab8fef70724ca096f2dca4","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst"}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1w-0\\+deb11u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openssl@1.1.1w-0%2Bdeb11u1?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-4813","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-4813","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"A flaw has been identified in glibc.

is an open source container framework that is a key component of Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container tooling or runtimes. Moby's networking implementation allows for many networks, each with their own IP address range and gateway, to be defined. This feature is frequently referred to as custom networks, as each network can have a different driver, set of parameters and thus behaviors. When creating a network, the `--internal` flag is used to designate a network as _internal_. The `internal` attribute in a docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_, and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.\n\nWhen containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique network interfaces and IP addresses. The host serves as a router for non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT to/from container IPs.\n\nContainers on an internal network may communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating with any networks the host has access to (LAN or WAN) as no default route is configured, and firewall rules are set up to drop all outgoing traffic. Communication with the gateway IP address (and thus appropriately configured host services) is possible, and the host may communicate with any container IP directly.\n\nIn addition to configuring the Linux kernel's various networking features to enable container networking, `dockerd` directly provides some services to container networks. Principal among these is serving as a resolver, enabling service discovery, and resolution of names from an upstream resolver.\n\nWhen a DNS request for a name that does not correspond to a container is received, the request is forwarded to the configured upstream resolver. This request is made from the container's network namespace: the level of access and routing of traffic is the same as if the request was made by the container itself.\n\nAs a consequence of this design, containers solely attached to an internal network will be unable to resolve names using the upstream resolver, as the container itself is unable to communicate with that nameserver. Only the names of containers also attached to the internal network are able to be resolved.\n\nMany systems run a local forwarding DNS resolver. As the host and any containers have separate loopback devices, a consequence of the design described above is that containers are unable to resolve names from the host's configured resolver, as they cannot reach these addresses on the host loopback device. To bridge this gap, and to allow containers to properly resolve names even when a local forwarding resolver is used on a loopback address, `dockerd` detects this scenario and instead forward DNS requests from the host namework namespace. The loopback resolver then forwards the requests to its configured upstream resolvers, as expected.\n\nBecause `dockerd` forwards DNS requests to the host loopback device, bypassing the container network namespace's normal routing semantics entirely, internal networks can unexpectedly forward DNS requests to an external nameserver. By registering a domain for which they control the authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will eventually be answered by their nameservers.\n\nDocker Desktop is not affected, as Docker Desktop always runs an internal resolver on a RFC 1918 address.\n\nMoby releases 26.0.0, 25.0.4, and 23.0.11 are patched to prevent forwarding any DNS requests from internal networks. As a workaround, run containers intended to be solely attached to internal networks with a custom upstream address, which will force all upstream DNS queries to be resolved from the container's network namespace.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-29018","epss":0.00222,"percentile":0.44733,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-29018","cwe":"CWE-669","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-29018","cwe":"CWE-669","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v23.0.3+incompatible"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-mq39-4gv4-mvpx","versionConstraint":"<23.0.11 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"23.0.11"}}],"artifact":{"id":"1673dfa9308905b2","name":"github.com/docker/docker","version":"v23.0.3+incompatible","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/promtail","layerID":"sha256:20a8cab59267bdb4d9646a3f1b80c2313f214789f55ea197f21d392dc655cc12","accessPath":"/usr/bin/promtail","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:docker:docker:v23.0.3\\+incompatible:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/docker/docker@v23.0.3%2Bincompatible","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.3","architecture":"amd64","mainModule":"github.com/grafana/loki"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-0727","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-0727","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack  Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted sources might terminate abruptly.

is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software containerization. The classic builder cache system is prone to cache poisoning if the image is built FROM scratch. Also, changes to some instructions (most important being HEALTHCHECK and ONBUILD) would not cause a cache miss. An attacker with the knowledge of the Dockerfile someone is using could poison their cache by making them pull a specially crafted image that would be considered as a valid cache candidate for some build steps. 23.0+ users are only affected if they explicitly opted out of Buildkit (DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 environment variable) or are using the /build API endpoint. All users on versions older than 23.0 could be impacted. Image build API endpoint (/build) and ImageBuild function from github.com/docker/docker/client is also affected as it the uses classic builder by default.

Chunk extensions are a little-used HTTP feature which permit including additional metadata in a request or response body sent using the chunked encoding.

Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in \"dangerous\" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience). This fix is part of the 4.5.1 release. We are aware that this changes the behaviour of an established function and is not 100 % backwards compatible, so updating to 4.5.1 might break your code. In case you cannot update to 4.5.0, please make sure that you are properly checking for all errors (\"dangerous\" ones first), so that you are not running in the case detailed above.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-51744","epss":0.00027,"percentile":0.06535,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-51744","cwe":"CWE-755","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v4","version":"v4.5.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-29wx-vh33-7x7r","versionConstraint":"<4.5.1 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.5.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"8ba4dad51c2057a5","name":"github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v4","version":"v4.5.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/promtail","layerID":"sha256:20a8cab59267bdb4d9646a3f1b80c2313f214789f55ea197f21d392dc655cc12","accessPath":"/usr/bin/promtail","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang-jwt:jwt\\/v4:v4.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:golang_jwt:jwt\\/v4:v4.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:golang:jwt\\/v4:v4.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/golang-jwt/jwt@v4.5.0#v4","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.3","architecture":"amd64","mainModule":"github.com/grafana/loki"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-29383","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-29383","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"In Shadow 4.13, it is possible to inject control characters into fields provided to the SUID program chfn (change finger).

or accessing files from unexpected locations, which a local attacker may be able to exploit.\n\nThe bug was introduced in commit 11a11ecf4bea72b17d250cfb43c897be1341861e and released in Perl version

is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc. that is distributed as Docker Engine, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various other downstream projects/products. A firewalld vulnerability affects Moby releases before 28.0.0. When firewalld reloads, Docker fails to re-create iptables rules that isolate bridge networks, allowing any container to access all ports on any other container across different bridge networks on the same host. This breaks network segmentation between containers that should be isolated, creating significant risk in multi-tenant environments. Only containers in --internal networks remain protected.\nWorkarounds include reloading firewalld and either restarting the docker daemon, re-creating bridge networks, or using rootless mode.

The timing signal is so small that it is infeasible to be detected without having the attacking process running on the same physical system.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27587","epss":0.00032,"percentile":0.08578,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27587","cwe":"CWE-385","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1w-0+deb11u1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-27587","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"199983e947119477","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1w-0+deb11u1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:1a58fc2f70c1d0cf50ef4632df1b1b0c96e862625fc85ab9f55d998a4ce68f43","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","layerID":"sha256:2cb58621b2c67ac6814bdbe73d9dcd2ac67899906eab8fef70724ca096f2dca4","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:2cb58621b2c67ac6814bdbe73d9dcd2ac67899906eab8fef70724ca096f2dca4","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:2cb58621b2c67ac6814bdbe73d9dcd2ac67899906eab8fef70724ca096f2dca4","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list","layerID":"sha256:2cb58621b2c67ac6814bdbe73d9dcd2ac67899906eab8fef70724ca096f2dca4","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst","layerID":"sha256:2cb58621b2c67ac6814bdbe73d9dcd2ac67899906eab8fef70724ca096f2dca4","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst"}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1w-0\\+deb11u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openssl@1.1.1w-0%2Bdeb11u1?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-0563","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-0563","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"Negligible","urls":[],"description":"A flaw was found in the util-linux chfn and chsh utilities when compiled with Readline support.
