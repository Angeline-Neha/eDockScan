Prior to versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20, a SSH server may allow an attacker to perform unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE). By exploiting a flaw in SSH protocol message handling, a malicious actor could gain unauthorized access to affected systems and execute arbitrary commands without valid credentials. This issue is patched in versions OTP-27.3.3, OTP-26.2.5.11, and OTP-25.3.2.20.

Implementation does not verify RFC specified limits on algorithm names (64 characters) provided in KEX init message. Big KEX init packet may lead to inefficient processing of the error data. As a result, large amount of memory will be allocated for processing malicious data. Versions OTP-27.3.1, OTP-26.2.5.10, and OTP-25.3.2.19 fix the issue. Some workarounds are available. One may set option `parallel_login` to `false` and/or reduce the `max_sessions` option.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-30211","epss":0.00073,"percentile":0.22715,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-30211","cwe":"CWE-789","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["25.3.2.19","26.2.5.10","27.3.1"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"25.3.2.19","date":"2025-04-01","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"26.2.5.10","date":"2025-04-01","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"27.3.1","date":"2025-04-01","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.05475},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:erlang:erlang\\/otp:25.3.2.15:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"erlang","version":"25.3.2.15"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-30211","versionConstraint":"< 25.3.2.19,>= 26, < 26.2.5.10,>= 27, < 27.3.1 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:erlang:erlang\\/otp:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"25.3.2.19"}}],"artifact":{"id":"51010e5f0f469c27","name":"erlang","version":"25.3.2.15","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/opt/erlang/lib/erlang/erts-13.2.2.11/bin/beam.smp","layerID":"sha256:a7fe6ea6b5b57775ee6a041c0c58e5a44c53eb34c5c8b6a7d55dea209b549929","accessPath":"/opt/erlang/lib/erlang/erts-13.2.2.11/bin/beam.smp","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/opt/erlang/lib/erlang/erts-13.2.2.11/bin/erlexec","layerID":"sha256:a7fe6ea6b5b57775ee6a041c0c58e5a44c53eb34c5c8b6a7d55dea209b549929","accessPath":"/opt/erlang/lib/erlang/erts-13.2.2.11/bin/erlexec","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:erlang:erlang\\/otp:25.3.2.15:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/erlang@25.3.2.15","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-13176","dataSource":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2024-13176","namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.20","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.1,"exploitabilityScore":0.7,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-13176","epss":0.00118,"percentile":0.31586,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-13176","cwe":"CWE-385","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.3.2-r2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.3.2-r2","date":"2025-02-08","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.05369},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-13176","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-13176","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/07272b05b04836a762b4baa874958af51d513844","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/2af62e74fb59bc469506bc37eb2990ea408d9467","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/392dcb336405a0c94486aa6655057f59fd3a0902","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4b1cb94a734a7d4ec363ac0a215a25c181e11f65","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/77c608f4c8857e63e98e66444e2e761c9627916f","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/0d5fd1ab987f7571e2c955d8d8b638fc0fb54ded","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/a2639000db19878d5d89586ae7b725080592ae86","https://openssl-library.org/news/secadv/20250120.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/01/20/2","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/05/msg00028.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250124-0005/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250418-0010/"],"description":"Issue summary: A timing side-channel which could potentially allow recovering\nthe private key exists in the ECDSA signature computation.\n\nImpact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations\ncould allow recovering the private key by an attacker.
