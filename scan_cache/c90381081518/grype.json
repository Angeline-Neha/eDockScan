Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45288","epss":0.66635,"percentile":0.98474,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.21.9","1.22.2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.21.9","date":"2024-04-06","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.22.2","date":"2024-04-06","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":49.97625},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.21.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.21.3"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45288","versionConstraint":"<

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead.

In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time.

If the non-default `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option is enabled, HTML including `javascript:` URLs that have been crafted with control characters will not be sanitized. If the site that this HTML is published on does not set a Content Security Policy, an XSS attack is then possible. This issue is patched in jsoup 1.15.3. Users should upgrade to this version.

Users may rate limit input parsing, limit the size of inputs based on system resources, and/or implement thread watchdogs to cap and timeout parse runtimes.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":10,"impactScore":2.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-37714","epss":0.00591,"percentile":0.68507,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-37714","cwe":"CWE-248","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2021-37714","cwe":"CWE-835","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2021-37714","cwe":"CWE-835","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"org.jsoup:jsoup","version":"1.7.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-m72m-mhq2-9p6c","versionConstraint":"<1.14.2 (unknown)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.14.2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"181810607b79853a","name":"jsoup","version":"1.7.2","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/gems/ruby-maven-libs-3.3.9/maven-home/lib/jsoup-1.7.2.jar","layerID":"sha256:c1ad8cdd07e0e46a1072c712ca772989188557772b1caf5275ba2428570f6d85","accessPath":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/gems/ruby-maven-libs-3.3.9/maven-home/lib/jsoup-1.7.2.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":["http://jsoup.com/license"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:org.jsoup:jsoup:1.7.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jsoup:jsoup:1.7.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/org.jsoup/jsoup@1.7.2","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/gems/ruby-maven-libs-3.3.9/maven-home/lib/jsoup-1.7.2.jar","pomArtifactID":"jsoup","pomGroupID":"org.jsoup","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"d7e275ba05aa380ca254f72d0c0ffebaedc3adcf"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-hww2-5g85-429m","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hww2-5g85-429m","namespace":"github:language:ruby","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"URI gem has ReDoS vulnerability","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-36617","epss":0.0086,"percentile":0.74441,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-36617","cwe":"CWE-1333","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.11.2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"0.11.2","date":"2024-03-15","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.44289999999999996},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-36617","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-36617","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/27LUWREIFTP3MQAW7QE4PJM4DPAQJWXF/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QA6XUKUY7B5OLNQBLHOT43UW7C5NIOQQ/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230725-0002/","https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2023/06/29/redos-in-uri-CVE-2023-36617/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/27LUWREIFTP3MQAW7QE4PJM4DPAQJWXF/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QA6XUKUY7B5OLNQBLHOT43UW7C5NIOQQ/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230725-0002/","https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2023/06/29/redos-in-uri-CVE-2023-36617/"],"description":"A ReDoS issue was discovered in the URI component before 0.12.2 for Ruby.

Prior to versions 2.2.11, 3.0.12, and 3.1.10, Rack::CommonLogger can be exploited by crafting input that includes newline characters to manipulate log entries. The supplied proof-of-concept demonstrates injecting malicious content into logs. When a user provides the authorization credentials via Rack::Auth::Basic, if success, the username will be put in env['REMOTE_USER'] and later be used by Rack::CommonLogger for logging purposes. The issue occurs when a server intentionally or unintentionally allows a user creation with the username contain CRLF and white space characters, or the server just want to log every login attempts. If an attacker enters a username with CRLF character, the logger will log the malicious username with CRLF characters into the logfile. Attackers can break log formats or insert fraudulent entries, potentially obscuring real activity or injecting malicious data into log files.

As workaround its possible to either disable the usage of the native SSLEngine or change the code manually.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-24970","epss":0.00322,"percentile":0.54927,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-24970","cwe":"CWE-20","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"io.netty:netty-handler","version":"4.1.100.Final"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4g8c-wm8x-jfhw","versionConstraint":">=4.1.91.Final,<=4.1.117.Final (unknown)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.1.118.Final"}}],"artifact":{"id":"d3fad30c55eac333","name":"netty-handler","version":"4.1.100.Final","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/gems/logstash-input-beats-6.7.1-java/vendor/jar-dependencies/io/netty/netty-handler/4.1.100.Final/netty-handler-4.1.100.Final.jar","layerID":"sha256:c1ad8cdd07e0e46a1072c712ca772989188557772b1caf5275ba2428570f6d85","accessPath":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/gems/logstash-input-beats-6.7.1-java/vendor/jar-dependencies/io/netty/netty-handler/4.1.100.Final/netty-handler-4.1.100.Final.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":["https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:io.netty.handler:netty-handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty.handler:netty_handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-handler:netty-handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-handler:netty_handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-project:netty-handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-project:netty_handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_handler:netty-handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_handler:netty_handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_project:netty-handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_project:netty_handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty.handler:handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty:netty-handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty:netty_handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:handler:netty-handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:handler:netty_handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-handler:handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-project:handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_handler:handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_project:handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty:netty-handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty:netty_handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty:handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:handler:handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty:handler:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/io.netty/netty-handler@4.1.100.Final","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/gems/logstash-input-beats-6.7.1-java/vendor/jar-dependencies/io/netty/netty-handler/4.1.100.Final/netty-handler-4.1.100.Final.jar","pomArtifactID":"netty-handler","pomGroupID":"io.netty","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"4c0acdb8bb73647ebb3847ac2d503d53d72c02b4"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-20952","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-20952","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00023.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0002/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2024.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00023.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240201-0002/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2024.html"],"description":"Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Security).

Prior to versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12, `Rack::Static` can serve files under the specified `root:` even if `urls:` are provided, which may expose other files under the specified `root:` unexpectedly. The vulnerability occurs because `Rack::Static` does not properly sanitize user-supplied paths before serving files. Specifically, encoded path traversal sequences are not correctly validated, allowing attackers to access files outside the designated static file directory. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain access to all files under the specified `root:` directory, provided they are able to determine then path of the file. Versions 2.2.13, 3.0.14, and 3.1.12 contain a patch for the issue. Other mitigations include removing usage of `Rack::Static`, or ensuring that `root:` points at a directory path which only contains files which should be accessed publicly. It is likely that a CDN or similar static file server would also mitigate the issue.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27610","epss":0.00228,"percentile":0.45712,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27610","cwe":"CWE-23","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"ruby-gem-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"ruby","namespace":"github:language:ruby","package":{"name":"rack","version":"2.2.8"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-7wqh-767x-r66v","versionConstraint":"<2.2.13 (gem)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.2.13"}}],"artifact":{"id":"96cdd977c396b400","name":"rack","version":"2.2.8","type":"gem","locations":[{"path":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/specifications/rack-2.2.8.gemspec","layerID":"sha256:c1ad8cdd07e0e46a1072c712ca772989188557772b1caf5275ba2428570f6d85","accessPath":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/specifications/rack-2.2.8.gemspec","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"ruby","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:rack:rack:2.2.8:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:gem/rack@2.2.8","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-21068","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21068","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Low","urls":["https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00014.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0004/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2024.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/04/msg00014.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240426-0004/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2024.html"],"description":"Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Hotspot).

Prior to versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14, `Rack::QueryParser` parses query strings and `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies into Ruby data structures without imposing any limit on the number of parameters, allowing attackers to send requests with extremely large numbers of parameters. The vulnerability arises because `Rack::QueryParser` iterates over each `&`-separated key-value pair and adds it to a Hash without enforcing an upper bound on the total number of parameters. This allows an attacker to send a single request containing hundreds of thousands (or more) of parameters, which consumes excessive memory and CPU during parsing. An attacker can trigger denial of service by sending specifically crafted HTTP requests, which can cause memory exhaustion or pin CPU resources, stalling or crashing the Rack server. This results in full service disruption until the affected worker is restarted. Versions 2.2.14, 3.0.16, and 3.1.14 fix the issue. Some other mitigations are available. One may use middleware to enforce a maximum query string size or parameter count, or employ a reverse proxy (such as Nginx) to limit request sizes and reject oversized query strings or bodies. Limiting request body sizes and query string lengths at the web server or CDN level is an effective mitigation.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-46727","epss":0.0021,"percentile":0.43701,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-46727","cwe":"CWE-400","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2025-46727","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"ruby-gem-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"ruby","namespace":"github:language:ruby","package":{"name":"rack","version":"2.2.8"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-gjh7-p2fx-99vx","versionConstraint":"<2.2.14

NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"arm-security@arm.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4039","epss":0.00181,"percentile":0.40242,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4039","cwe":"CWE-693","source":"arm-security@arm.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-4039","cwe":"NVD-CWE-Other","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"20.04"},"package":{"name":"gcc-10","version":"10.5.0-1ubuntu1~20.04"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:20.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-4039","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"e0bde9af5098887c","name":"libstdc++6","version":"10.5.0-1ubuntu1~20.04","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:5ad0e1151c2dd655be19b7e7be553d707b469f68a9c9e0ce68c3899ba66679b7","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/gcc-10-base/copyright","layerID":"sha256:6c3e7df31590f02f10cb71fc4eb27653e9b428df2e6e5421a455b062bd2e39f9","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libstdc++6/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libstdc++6:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:6c3e7df31590f02f10cb71fc4eb27653e9b428df2e6e5421a455b062bd2e39f9","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libstdc++6:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Artistic","GFDL-1.2","GPL","GPL-2","GPL-3","LGPL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libstdc\\+\\+6:libstdc\\+\\+6:10.5.0-1ubuntu1\\~20.04:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libstdc%2B%2B6@10.5.0-1ubuntu1~20.04?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-20.04&upstream=gcc-10","upstreams":[{"name":"gcc-10"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-50059","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-50059","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2025.html"],"description":"Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Networking).

Applications that do not call this function are not\nvulnerable. Our investigations indicate that this function is rarely used by\napplications.\n\nThe SSL_free_buffers function is used to free the internal OpenSSL buffer used\nwhen processing an incoming record from the network.

In versions prior to 2.2.19, 3.1.17, and 3.2.2, ``Rack::Multipart::Parser` stores non-file form fields (parts without a `filename`) entirely in memory as Ruby `String` objects. A single large text field in a multipart/form-data request (hundreds of megabytes or more) can consume equivalent process memory, potentially leading to out-of-memory (OOM) conditions and denial of service (DoS). Attackers can send large non-file fields to trigger excessive memory usage. Impact scales with request size and concurrency, potentially leading to worker crashes or severe garbage-collection overhead. All Rack applications processing multipart form submissions are affected. Versions 2.2.19, 3.1.17, and 3.2.2 enforce a reasonable size cap for non-file fields (e.g., 2 MiB). Workarounds include restricting maximum request body size at the web-server or proxy layer (e.g., Nginx `client_max_body_size`) and validating and rejecting unusually large form fields at the application level.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-61771","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.15955,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-61771","cwe":"CWE-400","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"ruby-gem-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"ruby","namespace":"github:language:ruby","package":{"name":"rack","version":"2.2.8"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-w9pc-fmgc-vxvw","versionConstraint":"<2.2.19 (gem)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.2.19"}}],"artifact":{"id":"96cdd977c396b400","name":"rack","version":"2.2.8","type":"gem","locations":[{"path":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/specifications/rack-2.2.8.gemspec","layerID":"sha256:c1ad8cdd07e0e46a1072c712ca772989188557772b1caf5275ba2428570f6d85","accessPath":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/specifications/rack-2.2.8.gemspec","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"ruby","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:rack:rack:2.2.8:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:gem/rack@2.2.8","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-5678","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-5678","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:20.04","severity":"Low","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-5678","epss":0.00122,"percentile":0.32292,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-5678","cwe":"CWE-606","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-5678","cwe":"CWE-754","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.21"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.21","date":"2024-02-06","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.036599999999999994},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-5678","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-5678","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=34efaef6c103d636ab507a0cc34dca4d3aecc055","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=710fee740904b6290fef0dd5536fbcedbc38ff0c","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db925ae2e65d0d925adef429afc37f75bd1c2017","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=ddeb4b6c6d527e54ce9a99cba785c0f7776e54b6","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231106.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=34efaef6c103d636ab507a0cc34dca4d3aecc055","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=710fee740904b6290fef0dd5536fbcedbc38ff0c","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db925ae2e65d0d925adef429afc37f75bd1c2017","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=ddeb4b6c6d527e54ce9a99cba785c0f7776e54b6","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231130-0010/","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231106.txt"],"description":"Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking\nexcessively long X9.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow.\n\nImpact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to\ngenerate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays.

The other functions affected by this\nare DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the\n\"-pubcheck\" option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-5678","epss":0.00122,"percentile":0.32292,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-5678","cwe":"CWE-606","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-5678","cwe":"CWE-754","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"20.04"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.20"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:20.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-5678","versionConstraint":"< 1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.21 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.21"}}],"artifact":{"id":"e16660f0237bb0bb","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.20","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:5ad0e1151c2dd655be19b7e7be553d707b469f68a9c9e0ce68c3899ba66679b7","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:5ad0e1151c2dd655be19b7e7be553d707b469f68a9c9e0ce68c3899ba66679b7","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:5ad0e1151c2dd655be19b7e7be553d707b469f68a9c9e0ce68c3899ba66679b7","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:5ad0e1151c2dd655be19b7e7be553d707b469f68a9c9e0ce68c3899ba66679b7","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list","layerID":"sha256:5ad0e1151c2dd655be19b7e7be553d707b469f68a9c9e0ce68c3899ba66679b7","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst","layerID":"sha256:5ad0e1151c2dd655be19b7e7be553d707b469f68a9c9e0ce68c3899ba66679b7","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst"}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.20:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/openssl@1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.20?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-20.04","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-33601","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-33601","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:20.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-33601","epss":0.00073,"percentile":0.22769,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-33601","cwe":"CWE-617","source":"3ff69d7a-14f2-4f67-a097-88dee7810d18","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["2.31-0ubuntu9.16"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"2.31-0ubuntu9.16","date":"2024-06-01","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0365},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-33601","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-33601","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/22/5","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00026.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240524-0014/","https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=advisories/GLIBC-SA-2024-0007","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/07/22/5","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/06/msg00026.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240524-0014/","https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=advisories/GLIBC-SA-2024-0007"],"description":"nscd: netgroup cache may terminate daemon on memory allocation failure\n\nThe Name Service Cache Daemon's (nscd) netgroup cache uses xmalloc or\nxrealloc and these functions may terminate the process due to a memory\nallocation failure resulting in a denial of service to the clients.

For that reason\nthe severity of this vulnerability is Low.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.1,"exploitabilityScore":0.7,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-13176","epss":0.00118,"percentile":0.31586,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-13176","cwe":"CWE-385","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"20.04"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.20"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:20.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-13176","versionConstraint":"< 1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.24 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.24"}}],"artifact":{"id":"e16660f0237bb0bb","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.20","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:5ad0e1151c2dd655be19b7e7be553d707b469f68a9c9e0ce68c3899ba66679b7","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:5ad0e1151c2dd655be19b7e7be553d707b469f68a9c9e0ce68c3899ba66679b7","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:5ad0e1151c2dd655be19b7e7be553d707b469f68a9c9e0ce68c3899ba66679b7","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:5ad0e1151c2dd655be19b7e7be553d707b469f68a9c9e0ce68c3899ba66679b7","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list","layerID":"sha256:5ad0e1151c2dd655be19b7e7be553d707b469f68a9c9e0ce68c3899ba66679b7","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst","layerID":"sha256:5ad0e1151c2dd655be19b7e7be553d707b469f68a9c9e0ce68c3899ba66679b7","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst"}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.20:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/openssl@1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.20?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-20.04","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-45336","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-45336","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/643100","https://go.dev/issue/70530","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/CAWXhan3Jww/m/bk9LAa-lCgAJ","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/bG8cv1muIBM/m/G461hA6lCgAJ","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3420","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250221-0003/"],"description":"The HTTP client drops sensitive headers after following a cross-domain redirect.

malicious HTTP sender can use chunk extensions to cause a receiver reading from a request or response body to read many more bytes from the network than are in the body. A malicious HTTP client can further exploit this to cause a server to automatically read a large amount of data (up to about 1GiB) when a handler fails to read the entire body of a request. Chunk extensions are a little-used HTTP feature which permit including additional metadata in a request or response body sent using the chunked encoding. The net/http chunked encoding reader discards this metadata. A sender can exploit this by inserting a large metadata segment with each byte transferred. The chunk reader now produces an error if the ratio of real body to encoded bytes grows too

possible arbitrary file read and SSRF vulnerability has been identified in Apache Kafka Client. Apache Kafka Clients accept configuration data for setting the SASL/OAUTHBEARER connection with the brokers, including \"sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url\" and \"sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url\". Apache Kafka allows clients to read an arbitrary file and return the content in the error log, or sending requests to an unintended location. In applications where Apache Kafka Clients configurations can be specified by an untrusted party, attackers may use the \"sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url\" and \"sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url\" configuratin to read arbitrary contents of the disk and environment variables or make requests to an unintended location. In particular, this flaw may be used in Apache Kafka Connect to escalate from REST API access to filesystem/environment/URL access, which may be undesirable in certain environments, including SaaS products. \n\nSince Apache Kafka 3.9.1/4.0.0, we have added a system property (\"-Dorg.apache.kafka.sasl.oauthbearer.allowed.urls\") to set the allowed urls in SASL JAAS configuration. In 3.9.1, it accepts all urls by default for backward compatibility. However in 4.0.0 and newer, the default value is empty list and users have to set the allowed urls explicitly.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27817","epss":0.00036,"percentile":0.1001,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27817","cwe":"CWE-918","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"org.apache.kafka:kafka-clients","version":"3.4.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-vgq5-3255-v292","versionConstraint":">=3.1.0,<3.9.1 (unknown)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.9.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"b0f3e7f9ab5278cd","name":"kafka-clients","version":"3.4.1","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/gems/logstash-integration-kafka-11.3.2-java/vendor/jar-dependencies/org/apache/kafka/kafka-clients/3.4.1/kafka-clients-3.4.1.jar","layerID":"sha256:c1ad8cdd07e0e46a1072c712ca772989188557772b1caf5275ba2428570f6d85","accessPath":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/gems/logstash-integration-kafka-11.3.2-java/vendor/jar-dependencies/org/apache/kafka/kafka-clients/3.4.1/kafka-clients-3.4.1.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:apache:kafka-clients:3.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:kafka_clients:3.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:kafka:3.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/org.apache.kafka/kafka-clients@3.4.1","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/gems/logstash-integration-kafka-11.3.2-java/vendor/jar-dependencies/org/apache/kafka/kafka-clients/3.4.1/kafka-clients-3.4.1.jar","pomArtifactID":"kafka-clients","pomGroupID":"org.apache.kafka","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"a2f55251deb3d31a21903a0cfbd4d1fa6b7463ca"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-61725","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61725","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/709860","https://go.dev/issue/75680","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/4Emdl2iQ_bI","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-4006"],"description":"The ParseAddress function constructeds domain-literal address components through repeated string concatenation.

Prior to versions 2.2.20, 3.1.18, and 3.2.3, a possible information disclosure vulnerability existed in `Rack::Sendfile` when running behind a proxy that supports `x-sendfile` headers (such as Nginx). Specially crafted headers could cause `Rack::Sendfile` to miscommunicate with the proxy and trigger unintended internal requests, potentially bypassing proxy-level access restrictions. When `Rack::Sendfile` received untrusted `x-sendfile-type` or `x-accel-mapping` headers from a client, it would interpret them as proxy configuration directives. This could cause the middleware to send a \"redirect\" response to the proxy, prompting it to reissue a new internal request that was not subject to the proxy's access controls. An attacker could exploit this by setting a crafted `x-sendfile-type: x-accel-redirect` header, setting a crafted `x-accel-mapping` header, and requesting a path that qualifies for proxy-based acceleration. Attackers could bypass proxy-enforced restrictions and access internal endpoints intended to be protected (such as administrative pages). The vulnerability did not allow arbitrary file reads but could expose sensitive application routes. This issue only affected systems meeting all of the following conditions: The application used `Rack::Sendfile` with a proxy that supports `x-accel-redirect` (e.g., Nginx); the proxy did **not** always set or remove the `x-sendfile-type` and `x-accel-mapping` headers; and the application exposed an endpoint that returned a body responding to `.to_path`. Users should upgrade to Rack versions 2.2.20, 3.1.18, or 3.2.3, which require explicit configuration to enable `x-accel-redirect`. Alternatively, configure the proxy to always set or strip the header, or in Rails applications, disable sendfile completely.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-61780","epss":0.00039,"percentile":0.11375,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-61780","cwe":"CWE-200","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2025-61780","cwe":"CWE-441","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2025-61780","cwe":"CWE-913","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"ruby-gem-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"ruby","namespace":"github:language:ruby","package":{"name":"rack","version":"2.2.8"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-r657-rxjc-j557","versionConstraint":"<2.2.20 (gem)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.2.20"}}],"artifact":{"id":"96cdd977c396b400","name":"rack","version":"2.2.8","type":"gem","locations":[{"path":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/specifications/rack-2.2.8.gemspec","layerID":"sha256:c1ad8cdd07e0e46a1072c712ca772989188557772b1caf5275ba2428570f6d85","accessPath":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/specifications/rack-2.2.8.gemspec","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"ruby","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:rack:rack:2.2.8:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:gem/rack@2.2.8","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-mr3q-g2mv-mr4q","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mr3q-g2mv-mr4q","namespace":"github:language:ruby","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"Sinatra is vulnerable to ReDoS through ETag header value generation","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-61921","epss":0.0007,"percentile":0.21792,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-61921","cwe":"CWE-1333","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["4.2.0"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"4.2.0","date":"2025-10-11","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.020999999999999998},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-61921","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61921","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19104","https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/issues/2120","https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/pull/1823","https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/pull/2121","https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/security/advisories/GHSA-mr3q-g2mv-mr4q"],"description":"Sinatra is a domain-specific language for creating web applications in Ruby.

Prior to version 2.2.14, when using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, simultaneous rack requests can restore a deleted rack session, which allows the unauthenticated user to occupy that session. Rack session middleware prepares the session at the beginning of request, then saves is back to the store with possible changes applied by host rack application. This way the session becomes to be a subject of race conditions in general sense over concurrent rack requests. When using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, and provided the attacker can acquire a session cookie (already a major issue), the session may be restored if the attacker can trigger a long running request (within that same session) adjacent to the user logging out, in order to retain illicit access even after a user has attempted to logout. Version 2.2.14 contains a patch for the issue. Some other mitigations are available. Either ensure the application invalidates sessions atomically by marking them as logged out e.g., using a `logged_out` flag, instead of deleting them, and check this flag on every request to prevent reuse; or implement a custom session store that tracks session invalidation timestamps and refuses to accept session data if the session was invalidated after the request began.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.2,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-32441","epss":0.00038,"percentile":0.11136,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-32441","cwe":"CWE-362","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2025-32441","cwe":"CWE-367","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2025-32441","cwe":"CWE-613","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"ruby-gem-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"ruby","namespace":"github:language:ruby","package":{"name":"rack","version":"2.2.8"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-vpfw-47h7-xj4g","versionConstraint":"<=2.2.13 (gem)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.2.14"}}],"artifact":{"id":"96cdd977c396b400","name":"rack","version":"2.2.8","type":"gem","locations":[{"path":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/specifications/rack-2.2.8.gemspec","layerID":"sha256:c1ad8cdd07e0e46a1072c712ca772989188557772b1caf5275ba2428570f6d85","accessPath":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/specifications/rack-2.2.8.gemspec","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"ruby","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:rack:rack:2.2.8:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:gem/rack@2.2.8","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-61723","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-61723","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/709858","https://go.dev/issue/75676","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/4Emdl2iQ_bI","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-4009"],"description":"The processing time for parsing some invalid inputs scales non-linearly with respect to the size of the input.

This is fixed in versions 4.1.125.Final of netty-codec and 4.2.5.Final of netty-codec-compression.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":6.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-58057","epss":0.00033,"percentile":0.08598,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-58057","cwe":"CWE-409","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"io.netty:netty-codec","version":"4.1.100.Final"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3p8m-j85q-pgmj","versionConstraint":"<4.1.125.Final (unknown)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.1.125.Final"}}],"artifact":{"id":"9cbd7c39d4de905d","name":"netty-codec","version":"4.1.100.Final","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/gems/logstash-input-http-3.7.3-java/vendor/jar-dependencies/io/netty/netty-codec/4.1.100.Final/netty-codec-4.1.100.Final.jar","layerID":"sha256:c1ad8cdd07e0e46a1072c712ca772989188557772b1caf5275ba2428570f6d85","accessPath":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/gems/logstash-input-http-3.7.3-java/vendor/jar-dependencies/io/netty/netty-codec/4.1.100.Final/netty-codec-4.1.100.Final.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":["https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:io.netty.codec:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty.codec:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-project:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-project:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_project:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_project:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-codec:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-codec:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_codec:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_codec:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty.codec:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-project:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_project:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:codec:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:codec:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-codec:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_codec:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:codec:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/io.netty/netty-codec@4.1.100.Final","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/usr/share/logstash/vendor/bundle/jruby/3.1.0/gems/logstash-input-http-3.7.3-java/vendor/jar-dependencies/io/netty/netty-codec/4.1.100.Final/netty-codec-4.1.100.Final.jar","pomArtifactID":"netty-codec","pomGroupID":"io.netty","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"9c3c71e7cf3b8ce3bfc9fa52a524b9ca7ddf259c"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-3p8m-j85q-pgmj","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3p8m-j85q-pgmj","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Netty's decoders vulnerable to DoS via zip bomb style attack","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-58057","epss":0.00033,"percentile":0.08598,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-58057","cwe":"CWE-409","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["4.1.125.Final"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"4.1.125.Final","date":"2025-09-04","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0165},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-58057","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-58057","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/9d804c54ce962408ae6418255a83a13924f7145d","https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-3p8m-j85q-pgmj"],"description":"Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients.

is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for development of maintainable high performance protocol servers and clients. In versions 4.1.124.Final, and 4.2.0.Alpha3 through 4.2.4.Final, Netty incorrectly accepts standalone newline characters (LF) as a chunk-size line terminator, regardless of a preceding carriage return (CR), instead of requiring CRLF per HTTP/1.1 standards. When combined with reverse proxies that parse LF differently (treating it as part of the chunk extension), attackers can craft requests that the proxy sees as one request but Netty processes as two, enabling request smuggling attacks.

threads have a working directory race condition where file operations may target unintended paths.\n\nIf a directory handle is open at thread creation, the process-wide current working directory is temporarily changed in order to clone that handle for the new thread, which is visible from any third (or more) thread already running. \n\nThis may lead to unintended operations such as loading code or accessing files from unexpected locations, which a local attacker may be able to exploit.\n\nThe bug was introduced in commit 11a11ecf4bea72b17d250cfb43c897be1341861e and released in Perl version

temp directory creation vulnerability exists in all versions of Guava, allowing an attacker with access to the machine to potentially access data in a temporary directory created by the Guava API com.google.common.io.Files.createTempDir(). By default, on unix-like systems, the created directory is world-readable (readable by an attacker with access to the system). The method in question has been marked @Deprecated in versions 30.0 and later and should not be used. For Android developers, we recommend choosing a temporary directory API provided by Android, such as context.getCacheDir().
