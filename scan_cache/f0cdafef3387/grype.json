This issue affects glibc 2.36 and newer.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.6,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-6246","epss":0.31786,"percentile":0.96594,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-6246","cwe":"CWE-122","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-6246","cwe":"CWE-787","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"16.04"},"package":{"name":"glibc","version":"2.23-0ubuntu11.3"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:16.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-6246","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"3460bb4209ceef28","name":"multiarch-support","version":"2.23-0ubuntu11.3","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:be96a3f634de79f523f07c7e4e0216c28af45eb5776e7a6238a2392f71e01069","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/multiarch-support/copyright","layerID":"sha256:be96a3f634de79f523f07c7e4e0216c28af45eb5776e7a6238a2392f71e01069","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/multiarch-support/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/multiarch-support.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:be96a3f634de79f523f07c7e4e0216c28af45eb5776e7a6238a2392f71e01069","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/multiarch-support.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/multiarch-support.list","layerID":"sha256:be96a3f634de79f523f07c7e4e0216c28af45eb5776e7a6238a2392f71e01069","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/multiarch-support.list"}],"language":"","licenses":["GPL-2","LGPL-2.1"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:multiarch-support:multiarch-support:2.23-0ubuntu11.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:multiarch-support:multiarch_support:2.23-0ubuntu11.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:multiarch_support:multiarch-support:2.23-0ubuntu11.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:multiarch_support:multiarch_support:2.23-0ubuntu11.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:multiarch:multiarch-support:2.23-0ubuntu11.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:multiarch:multiarch_support:2.23-0ubuntu11.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/multiarch-support@2.23-0ubuntu11.3?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-16.04&upstream=glibc","upstreams":[{"name":"glibc"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2019-18276","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2019-18276","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:16.04","severity":"Low","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-18276","epss":0.40022,"percentile":0.97154,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-18276","cwe":"CWE-273","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2019-18276","cwe":"CWE-273","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"not-fixed"},"advisories":[],"risk":12.0066},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2019-18276","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18276","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155498/Bash-5.0-Patch-11-Privilege-Escalation.html","https://github.com/bminor/bash/commit/951bdaad7a18cc0dc1036bba86b18b90874d39ff","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf9fa47ab66495c78bb4120b0754dd9531ca2ff0430f6685ac9b07772%40%3Cdev.mina.apache.org%3E","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-34","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200430-0003/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wGtxJ8opa8","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155498/Bash-5.0-Patch-11-Privilege-Escalation.html","https://github.com/bminor/bash/commit/951bdaad7a18cc0dc1036bba86b18b90874d39ff","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf9fa47ab66495c78bb4120b0754dd9531ca2ff0430f6685ac9b07772%40%3Cdev.mina.apache.org%3E","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202105-34","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200430-0003/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wGtxJ8opa8"],"description":"An issue was discovered in disable_priv_mode in shell.c in GNU Bash through 5.0 patch 11. By default, if Bash is run with its effective UID not equal to its real UID, it will drop privileges by setting its effective UID to its real UID. However, it does so incorrectly. On Linux and other systems that support \"saved UID\" functionality, the saved UID is not dropped. An attacker with command execution in the shell can use \"enable -f\" for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains privileges. However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","metrics":{"baseScore":7.2,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":10.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-18276","epss":0.40022,"percentile":0.97154,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-18276","cwe":"CWE-273","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2019-18276","cwe":"CWE-273","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"16.04"},"package":{"name":"bash","version":"4.3-14ubuntu1.4"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:16.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-18276","versionConstraint":"none

Shadow 4.13, it is possible to inject control characters into fields provided to the SUID program chfn (change finger).

vulnerability was found in Perl. This security issue occurs while Perl for Windows relies on the system path environment variable to find the shell (`cmd.exe`). When running an executable that uses the Windows Perl interpreter, Perl attempts to find and execute `cmd.exe` within the operating system. However, due to path search order issues, Perl initially looks for cmd.exe in the current working directory. This flaw allows an attacker with limited privileges to place`cmd.exe` in locations with weak permissions, such as `C:\\ProgramData`.
