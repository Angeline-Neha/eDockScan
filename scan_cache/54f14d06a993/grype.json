SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead.

In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time.

The resolved name should return a large number of IPv6 and IPv4, and the call to the getaddrinfo function should have the AF_INET6 address family with AI_CANONNAME, AI_ALL and AI_V4MAPPED as flags.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","epss":0.01895,"percentile":0.82683,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"20.04"},"package":{"name":"glibc","version":"2.31-0ubuntu9.12"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:20.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-4806","versionConstraint":"< 2.31-0ubuntu9.14 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.31-0ubuntu9.14"}}],"artifact":{"id":"b01d98f1033fd5e4","name":"libc6","version":"2.31-0ubuntu9.12","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:dca6e8f506f740962929ee9064fc54618819d9b416eb7f605370b0ac32d557cd","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libc6/copyright","layerID":"sha256:6c3e7df31590f02f10cb71fc4eb27653e9b428df2e6e5421a455b062bd2e39f9","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libc6/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:6c3e7df31590f02f10cb71fc4eb27653e9b428df2e6e5421a455b062bd2e39f9","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:6c3e7df31590f02f10cb71fc4eb27653e9b428df2e6e5421a455b062bd2e39f9","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["GPL-2","LGPL-2.1"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libc6:libc6:2.31-0ubuntu9.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libc6@2.31-0ubuntu9.12?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-20.04&upstream=glibc","upstreams":[{"name":"glibc"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-4gmj-3p3h-gm8h","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4gmj-3p3h-gm8h","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"es5-ext vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service in `function#copy` and `function#toStringTokens`","cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-27088","epss":0.01846,"percentile":0.82457,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-27088","cwe":"CWE-400","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-27088","cwe":"CWE-1333","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-27088","cwe":"CWE-1333","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.10.63"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"0.10.63","date":"2024-02-27","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.5538000000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-27088","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-27088","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/medikoo/es5-ext/commit/3551cdd7b2db08b1632841f819d008757d28e8e2","https://github.com/medikoo/es5-ext/commit/a52e95736690ad1d465ebcd9791d54570e294602","https://github.com/medikoo/es5-ext/issues/201","https://github.com/medikoo/es5-ext/security/advisories/GHSA-4gmj-3p3h-gm8h","https://github.com/medikoo/es5-ext/commit/3551cdd7b2db08b1632841f819d008757d28e8e2","https://github.com/medikoo/es5-ext/commit/a52e95736690ad1d465ebcd9791d54570e294602","https://github.com/medikoo/es5-ext/issues/201","https://github.com/medikoo/es5-ext/security/advisories/GHSA-4gmj-3p3h-gm8h"],"description":"es5-ext contains ECMAScript 5 extensions.

A request with a number of headers exceeding theserver.maxHeadersCount threshold could be used to crash a ws server. The vulnerability was fixed in ws@8.17.1 (e55e510) and backported to ws@7.5.10 (22c2876), ws@6.2.3 (eeb76d3), and ws@5.2.4 (4abd8f6). In vulnerable versions of ws, the issue can be mitigated in the following ways: 1. Reduce the maximum allowed length of the request headers using the --max-http-header-size=size and/or the maxHeaderSize options so that no more headers than the server.maxHeadersCount limit can be sent. 2. Set server.maxHeadersCount to 0 so that no limit is applied.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37890","epss":0.00541,"percentile":0.66921,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37890","cwe":"CWE-476","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"ws","version":"8.14.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3h5v-q93c-6h6q","versionConstraint":">=8.0.0,<8.17.1 (semantic)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"8.17.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"fb77cd55fda23bd6","name":"ws","version":"8.14.2","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/usr/share/kibana/node_modules/ws/package.json","layerID":"sha256:4e02926cb897aef4c213d2035c1ac04a6e3d494afd7b0f020a2c78b776cf6607","accessPath":"/usr/share/kibana/node_modules/ws/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:ws_project:ws:8.14.2:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/ws@8.14.2","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-2511","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-2511","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:20.04","severity":"Low","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-2511","epss":0.01175,"percentile":0.78147,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-2511","cwe":"CWE-1325","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.23"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.1.1f-1ubuntu2.23","date":"2024-08-01","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.3525},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-2511","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2511","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/7e4d731b1c07201ad9374c1cd9ac5263bdf35bce","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/b52867a9f618bb955bed2a3ce3db4d4f97ed8e5d","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e9d7083e241670332e0443da0f0d4ffb52829f08","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/5f8d25770ae6437db119dfc951e207271a326640","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240408.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/08/5","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/7e4d731b1c07201ad9374c1cd9ac5263bdf35bce","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/b52867a9f618bb955bed2a3ce3db4d4f97ed8e5d","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e9d7083e241670332e0443da0f0d4ffb52829f08","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/5f8d25770ae6437db119dfc951e207271a326640","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240503-0013/","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240408.txt"],"description":"Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause unbounded\nmemory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions\n\nImpact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to trigger\nunbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service\n\nThis problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option is\nbeing used (but not if early_data support is also configured and the default\nanti-replay protection is in use).

The vulnerability occurs in `micromatch.braces()` in `index.js` because the pattern `.*` will greedily match anything. By passing a malicious payload, the pattern matching will keep backtracking to the input while it doesn't find the closing bracket. As the input size increases, the consumption time will also increase until it causes the application to hang or slow down. There was a merged fix but further testing shows the issue persists. This issue should be mitigated by using a safe pattern that won't start backtracking the regular expression due to greedy matching.

Starting in version 4.5.0 and prior to versions 5.28.5, 6.21.1, and 7.2.3, undici uses `Math.random()` to choose the boundary for a multipart/form-data request. It is known that the output of `Math.random()` can be predicted if several of its generated values are known. If there is a mechanism in an app that sends multipart requests to an attacker-controlled website, they can use this to leak the necessary values. Therefore, an attacker can tamper with the requests going to the backend APIs if certain conditions are met. This is fixed in versions 5.28.5, 6.21.1, and 7.2.3.

Versions 0.30.2 and 1.12.0 contain a patch for the issue.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-58754","epss":0.00025,"percentile":0.05562,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-58754","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"javascript-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"javascript","namespace":"github:language:javascript","package":{"name":"axios","version":"1.6.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4hjh-wcwx-xvwj","versionConstraint":">=1.0.0,<1.12.0 (semantic)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.12.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"d9ea505e8bbb07f8","name":"axios","version":"1.6.0","type":"npm","locations":[{"path":"/usr/share/kibana/node_modules/axios/package.json","layerID":"sha256:4e02926cb897aef4c213d2035c1ac04a6e3d494afd7b0f020a2c78b776cf6607","accessPath":"/usr/share/kibana/node_modules/axios/package.json","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"javascript","licenses":["MIT"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:axios:axios:1.6.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:npm/axios@1.6.0","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-52f5-9888-hmc6","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-52f5-9888-hmc6","namespace":"github:language:javascript","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"tmp allows arbitrary temporary file / directory write via symbolic link `dir` parameter","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":2.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-54798","epss":0.00067,"percentile":0.21068,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-54798","cwe":"CWE-59","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.2.4"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"0.2.4","date":"2025-08-07","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.018425000000000004},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-54798","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-54798","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/commit/188b25e529496e37adaf1a1d9dccb40019a08b1b","https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/issues/207","https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/security/advisories/GHSA-52f5-9888-hmc6","https://github.com/raszi/node-tmp/security/advisories/GHSA-52f5-9888-hmc6"],"description":"tmp is a temporary file and directory creator for node.js.

Startinf in version 5.0.1 and prior to versions 5.11.3 and 6.1.1, a maliciously modified message can be passed to either `openpgp.verify` or `openpgp.decrypt`, causing these functions to return a valid signature verification result while returning data that was not actually signed. This flaw allows signature verifications of inline (non-detached) signed messages (using `openpgp.verify`) and signed-and-encrypted messages (using `openpgp.decrypt` with `verificationKeys`) to be spoofed, since both functions return extracted data that may not match the data that was originally signed. Detached signature verifications are not affected, as no signed data is returned in that case. In order to spoof a message, the attacker needs a single valid message signature (inline or detached) as well as the plaintext data that was legitimately signed, and can then construct an inline-signed message or signed-and-encrypted message with any data of the attacker's choice, which will appear as legitimately signed by affected versions of OpenPGP.js. In other words, any inline-signed message can be modified to return any other data (while still indicating that the signature was valid), and the same is true for signed+encrypted messages if the attacker can obtain a valid signature and encrypt a new message (of the attacker's choice) together with that signature. The issue has been patched in versions 5.11.3 and 6.1.1. Some workarounds are available. When verifying inline-signed messages, extract the message and signature(s) from the message returned by `openpgp.readMessage`, and verify the(/each) signature as a detached signature by passing the signature and a new message containing only the data (created using `openpgp.createMessage`) to `openpgp.verify`.

threads have a working directory race condition where file operations may target unintended paths.\n\nIf a directory handle is open at thread creation, the process-wide current working directory is temporarily changed in order to clone that handle for the new thread, which is visible from any third (or more) thread already running. \n\nThis may lead to unintended operations such as loading code or accessing files from unexpected locations, which a local attacker may be able to exploit.\n\nThe bug was introduced in commit 11a11ecf4bea72b17d250cfb43c897be1341861e and released in Perl version
