Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45288","epss":0.66635,"percentile":0.98456,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.21.9","1.22.2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.21.9","date":"2024-04-06","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.22.2","date":"2024-04-06","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":49.97625},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45288","versionConstraint":"< 1.21.9,>= 1.22.0-0, < 1.22.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.21.9"}}],"artifact":{"id":"355dda4d91d4eab4","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:2ff8c8e40e1aa496c0f72b7f9067c79c3f3a83a93087279b67371eed97dd4aba","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.16.7","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.7","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-1292","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1292","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:9","severity":"Critical","urls":[],"description":"The c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection.

BN_mod_sqrt() function, which computes a modular square root, contains a bug that can cause it to loop forever for non-prime moduli. Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue. In the OpenSSL 1.0.2 version the public key is not parsed during initial parsing of the certificate which makes it slightly harder to trigger the infinite loop. However any operation which requires the public key from the certificate will trigger the infinite loop. In particular the attacker can use a self-signed certificate to trigger the loop during verification of the certificate signature. This issue affects OpenSSL versions 1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.

Internally this function is used when parsing certificates that contain elliptic curve public keys in compressed form or explicit elliptic curve parameters with a base point encoded in compressed form. It is possible to trigger the infinite loop by crafting a certificate that has invalid explicit curve parameters. Since certificate parsing happens prior to verification of the certificate signature, any process that parses an externally supplied certificate may thus be subject to a denial of service attack. The infinite loop can also be reached when parsing crafted private keys as they can contain explicit elliptic curve parameters. Thus vulnerable situations include: - TLS clients consuming server certificates - TLS servers consuming client certificates - Hosting providers taking certificates or private keys from customers - Certificate authorities parsing certification requests from subscribers - Anything else which parses ASN.1 elliptic curve parameters Also any other applications that use the BN_mod_sqrt() where the attacker can control the parameter values are vulnerable to this DoS issue.

The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through runc run (\"attack 1\").

However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","metrics":{"baseScore":7.2,"exploitabilityScore":4,"impactScore":10.1},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-18276","epss":0.40022,"percentile":0.9715,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-18276","cwe":"CWE-273","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2019-18276","cwe":"CWE-273","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"9"},"package":{"name":"bash","version":"4.4-5"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:9"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-18276","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"5599e59b5ff3f50e","name":"bash","version":"4.4-5","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:bfe1049b03f05df7f289a28ec0d12c38ba0e7db73bb3c483cae56b1be9a09000","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/bash/copyright","layerID":"sha256:8f0b8fdd795ff9618717bb0bbfbb4729fbd8e201f9fbdd6b7d1a7e67ef1ab879","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/bash/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:8f0b8fdd795ff9618717bb0bbfbb4729fbd8e201f9fbdd6b7d1a7e67ef1ab879","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:8f0b8fdd795ff9618717bb0bbfbb4729fbd8e201f9fbdd6b7d1a7e67ef1ab879","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.postinst","layerID":"sha256:8f0b8fdd795ff9618717bb0bbfbb4729fbd8e201f9fbdd6b7d1a7e67ef1ab879","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.postinst"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.postrm","layerID":"sha256:8f0b8fdd795ff9618717bb0bbfbb4729fbd8e201f9fbdd6b7d1a7e67ef1ab879","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.postrm"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.preinst","layerID":"sha256:8f0b8fdd795ff9618717bb0bbfbb4729fbd8e201f9fbdd6b7d1a7e67ef1ab879","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.preinst"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.prerm","layerID":"sha256:8f0b8fdd795ff9618717bb0bbfbb4729fbd8e201f9fbdd6b7d1a7e67ef1ab879","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.prerm"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.list","layerID":"sha256:bfe1049b03f05df7f289a28ec0d12c38ba0e7db73bb3c483cae56b1be9a09000","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/bash.list"}],"language":"","licenses":["GPL-3"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:bash:bash:4.4-5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/bash@4.4-5?arch=amd64&distro=debian-9","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2017-5969","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5969","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:9","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"** DISPUTED ** libxml2 2.9.4, when used in recover mode, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via a crafted XML document.

do not properly consider backticks (`) as Javascript string delimiters, and do not escape them as expected. Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1, with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped. This should be used with caution.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24538","epss":0.00646,"percentile":0.69926,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24538","cwe":"CWE-94","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-24538","cwe":"CWE-94","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.8","1.20.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.19.8","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.20.3","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.60724},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-24538","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.8,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"355dda4d91d4eab4","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:2ff8c8e40e1aa496c0f72b7f9067c79c3f3a83a93087279b67371eed97dd4aba","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.16.7","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.7","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-1271","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1271","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:9","severity":"High","urls":[],"cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-1271","epss":0.00716,"percentile":0.7165,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-1271","cwe":"CWE-179","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-1271","cwe":"CWE-20","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.6-5+deb9u1"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.6-5+deb9u1","date":"2022-04-11","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.5835400000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-1271","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1271","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1271","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2073310","https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git%3Ba=commit%3Bh=69d1b3fc29677af8ade8dc15dba83f0589cb63d6","https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gzip/2022-04/msg00011.html","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1271","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-01","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220930-0006/","https://tukaani.org/xz/xzgrep-ZDI-CAN-16587.patch","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/07/8","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-1271","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2073310","https://git.tukaani.org/?p=xz.git%3Ba=commit%3Bh=69d1b3fc29677af8ade8dc15dba83f0589cb63d6","https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gzip/2022-04/msg00011.html","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-1271","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202209-01","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20220930-0006/","https://tukaani.org/xz/xzgrep-ZDI-CAN-16587.patch","https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/07/8"],"description":"An arbitrary file write vulnerability was found in GNU gzip's zgrep utility.

An attacker sending a request to a net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy proxy can exploit this mishandling to cause a denial of service by sending \"Expect: 100-continue\" requests which elicit a non-informational response from the backend.

This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in runc 1.1.2. This fix changes `runc exec --cap` behavior such that the additional capabilities granted to the process being executed (as specified via `--cap` arguments) do not include inheritable capabilities. In addition, `runc spec` is changed to not set any inheritable capabilities in the created example OCI spec (`config.json`)

is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":6,"exploitabilityScore":6.9,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":6,"exploitabilityScore":1.8,"impactScore":3.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-43784","epss":0.00129,"percentile":0.33291,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-43784","cwe":"CWE-190","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v95c-p5hm-xq8f","versionConstraint":"<1.0.3

It is possible there are larger keys in use in private PKIs, but we target the web PKI, so causing breakage here in the interests of increasing the default safety of users of crypto/tls seems reasonable.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-29409","epss":0.00112,"percentile":0.30454,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-29409","cwe":"CWE-400","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.12","1.20.7"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.19.12","date":"2023-08-12","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.20.7","date":"2023-08-12","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.057679999999999995},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-29409","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.12,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.7,= 1.21.0-rc1,= 1.21.0-rc2,= 1.21.0-rc3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.12"}}],"artifact":{"id":"355dda4d91d4eab4","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:2ff8c8e40e1aa496c0f72b7f9067c79c3f3a83a93087279b67371eed97dd4aba","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.16.7","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.7","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2018-7169","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7169","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:9","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"An issue was discovered in shadow 4.5. newgidmap (in shadow-utils) is setuid and allows an unprivileged user to be placed in a user namespace where setgroups(2) is permitted.

form parsing can consume large amounts of CPU and memory when processing form inputs containing very large numbers of parts. This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders=.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24536","epss":0.00066,"percentile":0.20683,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24536","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-24536","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.8","1.20.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.19.8","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.20.3","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0495},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-24536","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.8,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"355dda4d91d4eab4","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:2ff8c8e40e1aa496c0f72b7f9067c79c3f3a83a93087279b67371eed97dd4aba","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.16.7","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.7","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2018-16888","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-16888","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:9","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"It was discovered systemd does not correctly check the content of PIDFile files before using it to kill processes.

Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41725","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.15901,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41725","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.6"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.19.6","date":"2023-03-11","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.038250000000000006},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-41725","versionConstraint":"<

A malicious HTTP client can further exploit this to cause a server to automatically read a large amount of data (up to about 1GiB) when a handler fails to read the entire body of a request. Chunk extensions are a little-used HTTP feature which permit including additional metadata in a request or response body sent using the chunked encoding. The net/http chunked encoding reader discards this metadata. A sender can exploit this by inserting a large metadata segment with each byte transferred.

While this could be used to create empty files, existing files would not be truncated. An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced. Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict this attack's scope but the exact scope of protection hasn't been analysed. This is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and Kubernetes. The issue is fixed in runc v1.1.14 and v1.2.0-rc3.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Using user namespaces restricts this attack fairly significantly such that the attacker can only create inodes in directories that the remapped root user/group has write access to. Unless the root user is remapped to an actual\nuser on the host (such as with rootless containers that don't use `/etc/sub[ug]id`), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to create inodes in world-writable directories. A strict enough SELinux or AppArmor policy could in principle also restrict the scope if a specific label is applied to the runc runtime, though neither the extent to which the standard existing policies block this attack nor what exact policies are needed to sufficiently restrict this attack have been thoroughly tested.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45310","epss":0.00021,"percentile":0.04237,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45310","cwe":"CWE-61","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-45310","cwe":"CWE-363","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-jfvp-7x6p-h2pv","versionConstraint":"<1.1.14

This issue became much more relevant in approximately December 2019 when an unrelated bug was fixed (i.e., the chmod calls to suidusbins were fixed in the upstream Makefile which is now included in the release version 4.8).","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","metrics":{"baseScore":6.9,"exploitabilityScore":3.4,"impactScore":10.1},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-19882","epss":0.00094,"percentile":0.2711,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2019-19882","cwe":"CWE-732","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"9"},"package":{"name":"shadow","version":"1:4.4-4.1+deb9u1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:9"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2019-19882","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"7f22ff8dc2e150a3","name":"passwd","version":"1:4.4-4.1+deb9u1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:bfe1049b03f05df7f289a28ec0d12c38ba0e7db73bb3c483cae56b1be9a09000","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/passwd/copyright","layerID":"sha256:8f0b8fdd795ff9618717bb0bbfbb4729fbd8e201f9fbdd6b7d1a7e67ef1ab879","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/passwd/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:8f0b8fdd795ff9618717bb0bbfbb4729fbd8e201f9fbdd6b7d1a7e67ef1ab879","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:8f0b8fdd795ff9618717bb0bbfbb4729fbd8e201f9fbdd6b7d1a7e67ef1ab879","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.list","layerID":"sha256:8f0b8fdd795ff9618717bb0bbfbb4729fbd8e201f9fbdd6b7d1a7e67ef1ab879","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.postinst","layerID":"sha256:8f0b8fdd795ff9618717bb0bbfbb4729fbd8e201f9fbdd6b7d1a7e67ef1ab879","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.postinst"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.preinst","layerID":"sha256:8f0b8fdd795ff9618717bb0bbfbb4729fbd8e201f9fbdd6b7d1a7e67ef1ab879","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/passwd.preinst"}],"language":"","licenses":["GPL-2"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:passwd:passwd:1\\:4.4-4.1\\+deb9u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/passwd@1%3A4.4-4.1%2Bdeb9u1?arch=amd64&distro=debian-9&upstream=shadow","upstreams":[{"name":"shadow"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-58187","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-58187","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/709854","https://go.dev/issue/75681","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/4Emdl2iQ_bI","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-4007"],"description":"Due to the design of the name constraint checking algorithm, the processing time of some inputs scals non-linearly with respect to the size of the certificate.
