SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue.

NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list.

In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength.

The resolved name should return a large number of IPv6 and IPv4, and the call to the getaddrinfo function should have the AF_INET6 address family with AI_CANONNAME, AI_ALL and AI_V4MAPPED as flags.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","epss":0.01895,"percentile":0.82683,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"20.04"},"package":{"name":"glibc","version":"2.31-0ubuntu9.12"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:20.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-4806","versionConstraint":"< 2.31-0ubuntu9.14 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"2.31-0ubuntu9.14"}}],"artifact":{"id":"b01d98f1033fd5e4","name":"libc6","version":"2.31-0ubuntu9.12","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:750085e31ab4ea3ce71d88b4928c64a8412f16898afa06dcd5ca5354f2743db5","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libc6/copyright","layerID":"sha256:6c3e7df31590f02f10cb71fc4eb27653e9b428df2e6e5421a455b062bd2e39f9","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libc6/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:6c3e7df31590f02f10cb71fc4eb27653e9b428df2e6e5421a455b062bd2e39f9","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:6c3e7df31590f02f10cb71fc4eb27653e9b428df2e6e5421a455b062bd2e39f9","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["GPL-2","LGPL-2.1"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libc6:libc6:2.31-0ubuntu9.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libc6@2.31-0ubuntu9.12?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-20.04&upstream=glibc","upstreams":[{"name":"glibc"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-0553","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-0553","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:20.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-0553","epss":0.01029,"percentile":0.76728,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-0553","cwe":"CWE-203","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-0553","cwe":"CWE-203","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.6.13-2ubuntu1.10"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.6.13-2ubuntu1.10","date":"2024-01-23","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.5145000000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-0553","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0553","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0533","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0627","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0796","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1082","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1108","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1383","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2094","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-0553","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2258412","https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1522","https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnutls-help/2024-January/004841.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/19/3","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0533","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0627","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0796","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1082","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1108","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1383","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2094","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-0553","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2258412","https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1522","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/02/msg00010.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7ZEIOLORQ7N6WRPFXZSYDL2MC4LP7VFV/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GNXKVR5YNUEBNHAHM5GSYKBZX4W2HMN2/","https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnutls-help/2024-January/004841.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240202-0011/"],"description":"A vulnerability was found in GnuTLS.

An attacker can leverage this flaw by forcing a SUID process to crash and force the Linux kernel to recycle the process PID before systemd-coredump can analyze the /proc/pid/auxv file. If the attacker wins the race condition, they gain access to the original's SUID process coredump file. They can read sensitive content loaded into memory by the original binary, affecting data confidentiality.","cvss":[{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.7,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-4598","epss":0.00027,"percentile":0.06282,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-4598","cwe":"CWE-364","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"20.04"},"package":{"name":"systemd","version":"245.4-4ubuntu3.22"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:20.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-4598","versionConstraint":"none

is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for development of maintainable high performance protocol servers and clients. In versions 4.1.124.Final, and 4.2.0.Alpha3 through 4.2.4.Final, Netty incorrectly accepts standalone newline characters (LF) as a chunk-size line terminator, regardless of a preceding carriage return (CR), instead of requiring CRLF per HTTP/1.1 standards. When combined with reverse proxies that parse LF differently (treating it as part of the chunk extension), attackers can craft requests that the proxy sees as one request but Netty processes as two, enabling request smuggling attacks.
