Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send.

is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to an internal file descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-spawned container process (from runc exec) to have a working directory in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by giving access to the host filesystem (\"attack 2\"). The same attack could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to gain access to the host filesystem through runc run (\"attack 1\"). Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to overwrite semi-arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes (\"attack 3a\" and \"attack 3b\"). runc 1.1.12 includes patches for

This can lead to potential truncation\nor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.\n\nImpact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,\nwhich could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.\n\nWhen calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or\nEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after\nthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,\nvia the \"keylen\" parameter or the IV length, via the \"ivlen\" parameter,\nwithin the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially\ncausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers\nand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.\n\nFor the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in\nloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D\nsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in\nGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.\n\nBoth truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will\nproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory\nexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security\ncritical.\n\nChanging the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation\nand the vulnerable API was recently introduced.

This can lead to potential truncation\nor overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric ciphers.\n\nImpact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-uniqueness,\nwhich could result in loss of confidentiality for some cipher modes.\n\nWhen calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(), EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or\nEVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM array is processed after\nthe key and IV have been established.  Any alterations to the key length,\nvia the \"keylen\" parameter or the IV length, via the \"ivlen\" parameter,\nwithin the OSSL_PARAM array will not take effect as intended, potentially\ncausing truncation or overreading of these values.  The following ciphers\nand cipher modes are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB.\n\nFor the CCM, GCM and OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in\nloss of confidentiality.  For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D\nsection 8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in\nGCM mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse.\n\nBoth truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will\nproduce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory\nexception.  However, these issues are not currently assessed as security\ncritical.\n\nChanging the key and/or IV lengths is not considered to be a common operation\nand the vulnerable API was recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that\napplication developers will have spotted this problem during testing since\ndecryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were similarly\nvulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of an application being\nvulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an application is vulnerable then\nthis issue is considered very serious.

This flaw allows an unauthenticated, remote client or attacker to initiate a denial of service attack.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-0567","epss":0.01295,"percentile":0.79047,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-0567","cwe":"CWE-347","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-0567","cwe":"CWE-347","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"18.04"},"package":{"name":"gnutls28","version":"3.5.18-1ubuntu1.5"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-0567","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"66be6c699bfc4b9d","name":"libgnutls30","version":"3.5.18-1ubuntu1.5","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:3cca430711724c53e8220d1c3a3a717514ab9f317bb017b565aea6d18c0e66a4","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libgnutls30/copyright","layerID":"sha256:e722d396f503c712107acad2a081b07e33e73d6286c43f58234f69345a216918","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libgnutls30/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libgnutls30:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:e722d396f503c712107acad2a081b07e33e73d6286c43f58234f69345a216918","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libgnutls30:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["CC0","GFDL-1.3","GPL","GPL-3","LGPL","LGPL-3","LGPL2.1","The"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libgnutls30:libgnutls30:3.5.18-1ubuntu1.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libgnutls30@3.5.18-1ubuntu1.5?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-18.04&upstream=gnutls28","upstreams":[{"name":"gnutls28"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-24538","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-24538","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/482079","https://go.dev/issue/59234","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Xdv6JL9ENs8","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1703","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://go.dev/cl/482079","https://go.dev/issue/59234","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/Xdv6JL9ENs8","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2023-1703","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241115-0007/"],"description":"Templates do not properly consider backticks (`) as Javascript string delimiters, and do not escape them as expected. Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1, with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped. This should be used with caution.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24538","epss":0.00646,"percentile":0.69926,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24538","cwe":"CWE-94","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-24538","cwe":"CWE-94","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.8","1.20.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.19.8","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.20.3","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.60724},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-24538","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.8,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"355dda4d91d4eab4","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:76da091e29d7f47a6e83446bac0cf6009798e97612e7f2d722fb99970d6836ab","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.16.7","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.7","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-4806","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-4806","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04","severity":"Low","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","epss":0.01895,"percentile":0.82612,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"wont-fix"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.5685},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-4806","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4806","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2024:2413","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5453","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5455","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7409","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4806","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2237782","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/5","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/6","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/03/8","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5453","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:5455","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2023:7409","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2023-4806","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2237782","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/4DBUQRRPB47TC3NJOUIBVWUGFHBJAFDL/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DFG4P76UHHZEWQ26FWBXG76N2QLKKPZA/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/NDAQWHTSVOCOZ5K6KPIWKRT3JX4RTZUR/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202310-03","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240125-0008/"],"description":"A flaw has been identified in glibc.

public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for streaming\nASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the\nSMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by\nend user applications.\n\nThe function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter\nBIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of\nthe BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS\nrecipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function\nreturns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain\nis not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains\ninternal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO.

A correct q value,\nif present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is\nunnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.\n\nAn application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained\nfrom an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThe function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.\nAn application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.\nThe other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and\nEVP_PKEY_param_check().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications\nwhen using the \"-check\" option.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-3817","epss":0.0032,"percentile":0.54574,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-3817","cwe":"CWE-606","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-3817","cwe":"CWE-834","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"18.04"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.20"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-3817","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"6cc793337441fc8c","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.20","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:3cca430711724c53e8220d1c3a3a717514ab9f317bb017b565aea6d18c0e66a4","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libssl1.1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:76da091e29d7f47a6e83446bac0cf6009798e97612e7f2d722fb99970d6836ab","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:76da091e29d7f47a6e83446bac0cf6009798e97612e7f2d722fb99970d6836ab","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:76da091e29d7f47a6e83446bac0cf6009798e97612e7f2d722fb99970d6836ab","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list","layerID":"sha256:76da091e29d7f47a6e83446bac0cf6009798e97612e7f2d722fb99970d6836ab","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst","layerID":"sha256:76da091e29d7f47a6e83446bac0cf6009798e97612e7f2d722fb99970d6836ab","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst"}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1\\~18.04.20:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/openssl@1.1.1-1ubuntu2.1~18.04.20?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-18.04","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-20982","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-20982","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-20982","epss":0.00186,"percentile":0.40745,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"wont-fix"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.093},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-20982","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-20982","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2024.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2024.html"],"description":"Vulnerability in the MySQL Server product of Oracle MySQL (component: Server: Optimizer).

In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":6,"exploitabilityScore":6.9,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":6,"exploitabilityScore":1.8,"impactScore":3.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-43784","epss":0.00129,"percentile":0.33291,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-43784","cwe":"CWE-190","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v95c-p5hm-xq8f","versionConstraint":"<1.0.3 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.0.3"}}],"artifact":{"id":"83a6fbe6e8c0eaa7","name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.1","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:76da091e29d7f47a6e83446bac0cf6009798e97612e7f2d722fb99970d6836ab","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:opencontainers:runc:v1.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/opencontainers/runc@v1.0.1","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.7","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:G18PGckGdAm3yVQRWDVQ1rLSLntiniKJ0cNRT2Tm5gs=","mainModule":"github.com/tianon/gosu"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-21912","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-21912","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-21912","epss":0.0014,"percentile":0.34838,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"fix":{"versions":["5.7.42-0ubuntu0.18.04.1"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"5.7.42-0ubuntu0.18.04.1","date":"2023-05-09","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.06999999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-21912","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-21912","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230427-0007/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2023.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230427-0007/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2023.html"],"description":"Vulnerability in the MySQL Server product of Oracle MySQL (component: Server: Security: Privileges).

function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses and\ndecodes the \"name\" (e.g. \"CERTIFICATE\"), any header data and the payload data.\nIf the function succeeds then the \"name_out\", \"header\" and \"data\" arguments are\npopulated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The\ncaller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a\nPEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex()\nwill return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer\nto a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer\nthen a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash.

This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000 header fields across all parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders=.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24536","epss":0.00066,"percentile":0.20683,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24536","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-24536","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.8","1.20.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.19.8","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.20.3","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0495},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-24536","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.8,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"355dda4d91d4eab4","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:76da091e29d7f47a6e83446bac0cf6009798e97612e7f2d722fb99970d6836ab","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.16.7","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.7","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-3116","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2022-3116","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-3116","epss":0.00098,"percentile":0.2796,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-3116","cwe":"CWE-476","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-3116","cwe":"CWE-476","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["7.5.0+dfsg-1ubuntu0.1"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"7.5.0+dfsg-1ubuntu0.1","date":"2022-10-15","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.049},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-3116","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-3116","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230505-0010/","https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/730793","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230505-0010/","https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/730793"],"description":"The Heimdal Software Kerberos 5 implementation is vulnerable to a null pointer dereferance.

denial of service is possible from excessive resource consumption in net/http and mime/multipart. Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part may be reenabled with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41725","epss":0.00051,"percentile":0.15901,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41725","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.6"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.19.6","date":"2023-03-11","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.038250000000000006},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-41725","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.6,= 1.20.0,= 1.20.0-rc1,= 1.20.0-rc2,= 1.20.0-rc3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.6"}}],"artifact":{"id":"355dda4d91d4eab4","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:76da091e29d7f47a6e83446bac0cf6009798e97612e7f2d722fb99970d6836ab","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.16.7","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.7","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-5678","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2023-5678","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04","severity":"Low","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-5678","epss":0.00122,"percentile":0.32194,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-5678","cwe":"CWE-606","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-5678","cwe":"CWE-754","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"wont-fix"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.036599999999999994},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-5678","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-5678","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=34efaef6c103d636ab507a0cc34dca4d3aecc055","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=710fee740904b6290fef0dd5536fbcedbc38ff0c","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db925ae2e65d0d925adef429afc37f75bd1c2017","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=ddeb4b6c6d527e54ce9a99cba785c0f7776e54b6","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231106.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/11/1","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=34efaef6c103d636ab507a0cc34dca4d3aecc055","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=710fee740904b6290fef0dd5536fbcedbc38ff0c","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db925ae2e65d0d925adef429afc37f75bd1c2017","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=ddeb4b6c6d527e54ce9a99cba785c0f7776e54b6","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231130-0010/","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20231106.txt"],"description":"Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking\nexcessively long X9.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow.\n\nImpact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to\ngenerate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays.

However the implementation of the function does not\nenable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect\npolicies to pass the certificate verification.\n\nAs suddenly enabling the policy check could break existing deployments it was\ndecided to keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy()\nfunction.\n\nInstead the applications that require OpenSSL to

malicious HTTP sender can use chunk extensions to cause a receiver reading from a request or response body to read many more bytes from the network than are in the body. A malicious HTTP client can further exploit this to cause a server to automatically read a large amount of data (up to about 1GiB) when a handler fails to read the entire body of a request. Chunk extensions are a little-used HTTP feature which permit including additional metadata in a request or response body sent using the chunked encoding.

which compile regular expressions from untrusted sources may be vulnerable to memory exhaustion or denial of service. The parsed regexp representation is linear in the size of the input, but in some cases the constant factor can be as high as 40,000, making relatively small regexps consume much larger amounts of memory. After fix, each regexp being parsed is limited to a 256 MB memory footprint. Regular expressions whose representation would use more space than that are rejected. Normal use of regular expressions is unaffected.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41715","epss":0.00014,"percentile":0.01799,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41715","cwe":"NVD-CWE-Other","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.18.7","1.19.2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.18.7","date":"2022-10-20","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.19.2","date":"2022-10-20","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.010499999999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-41715","versionConstraint":"< 1.18.7,>= 1.19.0, < 1.19.2 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.18.7"}}],"artifact":{"id":"355dda4d91d4eab4","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:76da091e29d7f47a6e83446bac0cf6009798e97612e7f2d722fb99970d6836ab","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.16.7","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.7","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-2879","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2879","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/439355","https://go.dev/issue/54853","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/xtuG5faxtaU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-1037","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09","https://go.dev/cl/439355","https://go.dev/issue/54853","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/xtuG5faxtaU","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2022-1037","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202311-09"],"description":"Reader.Read does not set a limit on the maximum size of file headers.

While this could be used to create empty files, existing files would not be truncated. An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom volume configuration. Containers using user namespaces are still affected, but the scope of places an attacker can create inodes can be significantly reduced. Sufficiently strict LSM policies (SELinux/Apparmor) can also in principle block this attack -- we suspect the industry standard SELinux policy may restrict this attack's scope but the exact scope of protection hasn't been analysed. This is exploitable using runc directly as well as through Docker and Kubernetes. The issue is fixed in runc v1.1.14 and v1.2.0-rc3.\n\nSome workarounds are available. Using user namespaces restricts this attack fairly significantly such that the attacker can only create inodes in directories that the remapped root user/group has write access to. Unless the root user is remapped to an actual\nuser on the host (such as with rootless containers that don't use `/etc/sub[ug]id`), this in practice means that an attacker would only be able to create inodes in world-writable directories. A strict enough SELinux or AppArmor policy could in principle also restrict the scope if a specific label is applied to the runc runtime, though neither the extent to which the standard existing policies block this attack nor what exact policies are needed to sufficiently restrict this attack have been thoroughly tested.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.6,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45310","epss":0.00021,"percentile":0.04237,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45310","cwe":"CWE-61","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-45310","cwe":"CWE-363","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.1"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-jfvp-7x6p-h2pv","versionConstraint":"<1.1.14 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.14"}}],"artifact":{"id":"83a6fbe6e8c0eaa7","name":"github.com/opencontainers/runc","version":"v1.0.1","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:76da091e29d7f47a6e83446bac0cf6009798e97612e7f2d722fb99970d6836ab","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:opencontainers:runc:v1.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/opencontainers/runc@v1.0.1","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.7","architecture":"x86_64","h1Digest":"h1:G18PGckGdAm3yVQRWDVQ1rLSLntiniKJ0cNRT2Tm5gs=","mainModule":"github.com/tianon/gosu"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-0232","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-0232","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-0232","epss":0.00018,"percentile":0.03461,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-0232","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-0232","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"wont-fix"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.009000000000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-0232","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0232","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-0232","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2243754","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-0232","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2243754","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QDCMYQ3J45NHQ4EJREM3BJNNKB5BK4Y7/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240315-0007/"],"description":"A heap use-after-free issue has been identified in SQLite in the jsonParseAddNodeArray() function in sqlite3.c.

Similarly, if a setuid/setgid program is terminated, either via panic or signal, it may leak the contents of its registers.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-29403","epss":0.00009,"percentile":0.0067,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-29403","cwe":"CWE-668","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.10","1.20.5"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.19.10","date":"2023-06-16","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.20.5","date":"2023-06-16","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.0068850000000000005},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-29403","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.10,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.5 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.10"}}],"artifact":{"id":"355dda4d91d4eab4","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.16.7","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:76da091e29d7f47a6e83446bac0cf6009798e97612e7f2d722fb99970d6836ab","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.16.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.16.7","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.16.7","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-22866","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22866","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/643735","https://go.dev/issue/71383","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/xU1ZCHUZw3k","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3447","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250221-0002/"],"description":"Due to the usage of a variable time instruction in the assembly implementation of an internal function, a small number of bits of secret scalars are leaked on the ppc64le architecture.
