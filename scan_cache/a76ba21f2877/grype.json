summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to be sent to the peer.  Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling application.  The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports that there was no overlap in the lists).  This function is typically called from a server side application callback for ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\" response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it will be vulnerable to this problem.  In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of confidentiality will occur.  This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not widely used.

Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained\nfrom an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nThe function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those\nchecks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use\na very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which\nis over 10,000 bits in length.\n\nHowever the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters\nthat have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value\neven if it has already been found to be too large.\n\nAn application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained\nfrom an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThe function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions.\nAn application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.\nThe other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and\nEVP_PKEY_param_check().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications\nwhen using the '-check' option.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-3446","epss":0.00949,"percentile":0.75626,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-3446","cwe":"CWE-606","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-3446","cwe":"CWE-1333","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u5"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-3446","versionConstraint":"< 1.1.1v-0~deb11u1 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.1v-0~deb11u1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"7e1cd4cbe30867c5","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u5","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:6bfdaa4a0931d5ace4f9ecd8d3eced3f2f159241517b736b0c6662e103c4dd33","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","layerID":"sha256:6bfdaa4a0931d5ace4f9ecd8d3eced3f2f159241517b736b0c6662e103c4dd33","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:6bfdaa4a0931d5ace4f9ecd8d3eced3f2f159241517b736b0c6662e103c4dd33","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:6bfdaa4a0931d5ace4f9ecd8d3eced3f2f159241517b736b0c6662e103c4dd33","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list","layerID":"sha256:6bfdaa4a0931d5ace4f9ecd8d3eced3f2f159241517b736b0c6662e103c4dd33","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst","layerID":"sha256:6bfdaa4a0931d5ace4f9ecd8d3eced3f2f159241517b736b0c6662e103c4dd33","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst"}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1n-0\\+deb11u5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openssl@1.1.1n-0%2Bdeb11u5?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-33560","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-33560","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Libgcrypt before 1.8.8 and 1.9.x before 1.9.3 mishandles ElGamal encryption because it lacks exponent blinding to address a side-channel attack against mpi_powm, and the window size is not chosen appropriately.

The `SniHandler` can allocate up to 16MB of heap for each channel during the TLS handshake. When the handler or the channel does not have an idle timeout, it can be used to make a TCP server using the `SniHandler` to allocate 16MB of heap. The `SniHandler` class is a handler that waits for the TLS handshake to configure a `SslHandler` according to the indicated server name by the `ClientHello` record. For this matter it allocates a `ByteBuf` using the value defined in the `ClientHello` record.

The other functions affected by this\nare DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and EVP_PKEY_generate().\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line application when using the\n\"-pubcheck\" option, as well as the OpenSSL genpkey command line application.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-5678","epss":0.00527,"percentile":0.66275,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-5678","cwe":"CWE-606","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-5678","cwe":"CWE-754","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u5"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-5678","versionConstraint":"< 1.1.1w-0+deb11u2 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.1w-0+deb11u2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"7e1cd4cbe30867c5","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u5","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:6bfdaa4a0931d5ace4f9ecd8d3eced3f2f159241517b736b0c6662e103c4dd33","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","layerID":"sha256:6bfdaa4a0931d5ace4f9ecd8d3eced3f2f159241517b736b0c6662e103c4dd33","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:6bfdaa4a0931d5ace4f9ecd8d3eced3f2f159241517b736b0c6662e103c4dd33","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:6bfdaa4a0931d5ace4f9ecd8d3eced3f2f159241517b736b0c6662e103c4dd33","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list","layerID":"sha256:6bfdaa4a0931d5ace4f9ecd8d3eced3f2f159241517b736b0c6662e103c4dd33","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst","layerID":"sha256:6bfdaa4a0931d5ace4f9ecd8d3eced3f2f159241517b736b0c6662e103c4dd33","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst"}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1n-0\\+deb11u5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openssl@1.1.1n-0%2Bdeb11u5?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-4g8c-wm8x-jfhw","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4g8c-wm8x-jfhw","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"SslHandler doesn't correctly validate packets which can lead to native crash when using native SSLEngine","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-24970","epss":0.00359,"percentile":0.57393,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-24970","cwe":"CWE-20","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["4.1.118.Final"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"4.1.118.Final","date":"2025-02-11","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.26925},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-24970","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-24970","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/netty/netty/commit/87f40725155b2f89adfde68c7732f97c153676c4","https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-4g8c-wm8x-jfhw","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250221-0005/","https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/cve-2025-24970-netty-vulnerability-detection","https://www.vicarius.io/vsociety/posts/cve-2025-24970-netty-vulnerability-mitigation","https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-4g8c-wm8x-jfhw"],"description":"Netty, an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework, has a vulnerability starting in version 4.1.91.Final and prior to version 4.1.118.Final.

Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.  The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.  An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.  The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected.

A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12 files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will be vulnerable to this issue.

Impact summary: A timing side-channel in ECDSA signature computations could allow recovering the private key by an attacker. However, measuring the timing would require either local access to the signing application or a very fast network connection with low latency.  There is a timing signal of around 300 nanoseconds when the top word of the inverted ECDSA nonce value is zero. This can happen with significant probability only for some of the supported elliptic curves. In particular the NIST P-521 curve is affected.

This can be used to stop attackers from using the declared class property of Java enum objects to get access to the classloader. However this protection was not enabled by default. PropertyUtilsBean (and consequently BeanUtilsBean) now disallows declared class level property access by default.\n\n\n\n\n\nReleases 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 address a potential security issue when accessing enum properties in an uncontrolled way. If an application using Commons BeanUtils passes property paths from an external source directly to the getProperty() method of PropertyUtilsBean, an attacker can access the enum’s class loader via the “declaredClass” property available on all Java “enum” objects.

This can be used to stop attackers from using the declared class property of Java enum objects to get access to the classloader. However this protection was not enabled by default. PropertyUtilsBean (and consequently BeanUtilsBean) now disallows declared class level property access by default.\n\n\n\n\n\nReleases 1.11.0 and 2.0.0-M2 address a potential security issue when accessing enum properties in an uncontrolled way. If an application using Commons BeanUtils passes property paths from an external source directly to the getProperty() method of PropertyUtilsBean, an attacker can access the enum’s class loader via the “declaredClass” property available on all Java “enum” objects. Accessing the enum’s “declaredClass” allows remote attackers to access the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code.

This flaw allows an attacker to force a SUID process to crash and replace it with a non-SUID binary to access the original's privileged process coredump, allowing the attacker to read sensitive data, such as /etc/shadow content, loaded by the original process.\n\nA SUID binary or process has a special type of permission, which allows the process to run with the file owner's permissions, regardless of the user executing the binary. This allows the process to access more restricted data than unprivileged users or processes would be able to.

The format for the PAX extended headers carrying this data consists of two numbers separated by a period [2], indicating seconds and subsecond precision (for example “1647221103.5998539”). The impacted fields are “atime”, “ctime”, “mtime” and “LIBARCHIVE.creationtime”. No input validation is performed prior to the parsing of header values.\n\nParsing of these numbers uses the BigDecimal [3] class from the JDK which has a publicly known algorithmic complexity issue when doing operations on large numbers, causing denial of service (see issue # JDK-6560193 [4]). A third party can manipulate file time headers in a TAR file by placing a number with a very long fraction (300,000 digits) or a number with exponent notation (such as “9e9999999”) within a file modification time header, and the parsing of files with these headers will take hours instead of seconds, leading to a denial of service via exhaustion of CPU resources. This issue is similar to CVE-2012-2098 [5].\n\n[1]:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COMPRESS-612 \n[2]:  https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/pax.html#tag_20_92_13_05 \n[3]:  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html \n[4]:  https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-6560193 \n[5]:  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2098 \n\nOnly applications using CompressorStreamFactory class (with auto-detection of file types), TarArchiveInputStream and TarFile classes to parse TAR files are impacted.

If a directory handle is open at thread creation, the process-wide current working directory is temporarily changed in order to clone that handle for the new thread, which is visible from any third (or more) thread already running.
