One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the protocol specification implies that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG records.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-50387","epss":0.39615,"percentile":0.97132,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-50387","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-50387","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"10"},"package":{"name":"systemd","version":"241-7~deb10u3"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-50387","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"891e4ad9c0082d3b","name":"libudev1","version":"241-7~deb10u3","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:34b4fc871ab1cf2e528f564ec093aa4d8621f88cfc38a72c7c6ff8f6ecce1ce2","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libudev1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:c2adabaecedbda0af72b153c6499a0555f3a769d52370469d8f6bd6328af9b13","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libudev1/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libudev1:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:c2adabaecedbda0af72b153c6499a0555f3a769d52370469d8f6bd6328af9b13","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libudev1:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["CC0-1.0","Expat","GPL-2","GPL-2+","LGPL-2.1","LGPL-2.1+","public-domain"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libudev1:libudev1:241-7\\~deb10u3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libudev1@241-7~deb10u3?arch=amd64&distro=debian-10&upstream=systemd","upstreams":[{"name":"systemd"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-24834","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24834","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-p8x2-9v9q-c838","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MIF5MAGYARYUMRFK7PQI7HYXMK2HZE5T/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TDNNH2ONMVNBQ6LUIAOAGDNFPKXNST5K/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230814-0006/","https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-p8x2-9v9q-c838","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MIF5MAGYARYUMRFK7PQI7HYXMK2HZE5T/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TDNNH2ONMVNBQ6LUIAOAGDNFPKXNST5K/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230814-0006/"],"description":"Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk.

exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability.

is an in-memory database that persists on disk. By exploiting weaknesses in the Lua script execution environment, an attacker with access to Redis prior to version 7.0.0 or 6.2.7 can inject Lua code that will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another Redis user. The Lua script execution environment in Redis provides some measures that prevent a script from creating side effects that persist and can affect the execution of the same, or different script, at a later time. Several weaknesses of these measures have been publicly known for a long time, but they had no security impact as the Redis security model did not endorse the concept of users or privileges. With the introduction of ACLs in Redis 6.0, these weaknesses can be exploited by a less privileged users to inject Lua code that will execute at a later time, when a privileged user executes a Lua script. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0 and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being used, is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using ACL

The resolved name should return a large number of IPv6 and IPv4, and the call to the getaddrinfo function should have the AF_INET6 address family with AI_CANONNAME, AI_ALL and AI_V4MAPPED as flags.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","epss":0.01895,"percentile":0.82646,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"10"},"package":{"name":"glibc","version":"2.28-10"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-4806","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"3885776e13200a70","name":"libc6","version":"2.28-10","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:34b4fc871ab1cf2e528f564ec093aa4d8621f88cfc38a72c7c6ff8f6ecce1ce2","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libc6/copyright","layerID":"sha256:c2adabaecedbda0af72b153c6499a0555f3a769d52370469d8f6bd6328af9b13","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libc6/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:c2adabaecedbda0af72b153c6499a0555f3a769d52370469d8f6bd6328af9b13","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:c2adabaecedbda0af72b153c6499a0555f3a769d52370469d8f6bd6328af9b13","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["GPL-2","LGPL-2.1"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libc6:libc6:2.28-10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libc6@2.28-10?arch=amd64&distro=debian-10&upstream=glibc","upstreams":[{"name":"glibc"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-0361","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-0361","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"A timing side-channel in the handling of RSA ClientKeyExchange messages was discovered in GnuTLS.

In affected versions specially crafted Lua scripts executing in Redis can cause the heap-based Lua stack to be overflowed, due to incomplete checks for this condition. This can result with heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. This problem exists in all versions of Redis with Lua scripting support, starting from 2.6. The problem is fixed in versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. For users unable to update an additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing Lua scripts. This can be done using ACL to restrict EVAL and EVALSHA

A vulnerability involving out-of-bounds read and integer overflow to buffer overflow exists starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 5.0.13, 6.0.15, and 6.2.5. On 32-bit systems, Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to integer overflow that can potentially be exploited to corrupt the heap, leak arbitrary heap contents or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted commands bit commands. This problem only affects Redis on 32-bit platforms, or compiled as a 32-bit binary. Redis versions 5.0.`3m 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 contain patches for this issue. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":6,"exploitabilityScore":6.9,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32761","epss":0.00633,"percentile":0.69562,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-32761","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2021-32761","cwe":"CWE-680","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2021-32761","cwe":"CWE-190","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["5.0.13","6.0.15","6.2.5"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"5.0.13","date":"2022-07-05","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"6.0.15","date":"2022-07-05","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"6.2.5","date":"2022-07-05","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.45892499999999997},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:4.0.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"redis","version":"4.0.14"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2021-32761","versionConstraint":">= 2.2.0, < 5.0.13,>= 6.0, < 6.0.15,>= 6.2.0, < 6.2.5 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"5.0.13"}}],"artifact":{"id":"07ad6a4ae51cfdba","name":"redis","version":"4.0.14","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/redis-server","layerID":"sha256:34b4fc871ab1cf2e528f564ec093aa4d8621f88cfc38a72c7c6ff8f6ecce1ce2","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/redis-server","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:4.0.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:4.0.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/redis@4.0.14","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-33599","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-33599","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"nscd: Stack-based buffer overflow in netgroup cache  If the Name Service Cache Daemon's (nscd) fixed size cache is exhausted by client requests then a subsequent client request for netgroup data may result in a stack-based buffer overflow.

In affected versions of Redis an integer overflow bug in 32-bit Redis version 4.0 or newer could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. Redis 4.0 or newer uses a configurable limit for the maximum supported bulk input size. By default, it is 512MB which is a safe value for all platforms. If the limit is significantly increased, receiving a large request from a client may trigger several integer overflow scenarios, which would result with buffer overflow and heap corruption. We believe this could in certain conditions be exploited for remote code execution. By default, authenticated Redis users have access to all configuration parameters and can therefore use the “CONFIG SET proto-max-bulk-len” to change the safe default, making the system vulnerable. **This problem only affects 32-bit Redis (on a 32-bit system, or as a 32-bit executable running on a 64-bit system).** The problem is fixed in version 6.2, and the fix is back ported to 6.0.11 and 5.0.11. Make sure you use one of these versions if you are running 32-bit Redis. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent clients from directly executing `CONFIG SET`: Using Redis 6.0 or newer, ACL configuration can be used to block the command. Using older versions, the `rename-command` configuration directive can be used to rename the command to a random string unknown to users, rendering it inaccessible. Please note that this workaround may have an additional impact on users or operational systems that expect `CONFIG SET` to behave in certain ways.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"2.0","vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":8,"impactScore":6.5},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-21309","epss":0.00464,"percentile":0.63478,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-21309","cwe":"CWE-190","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["5.0.11","6.0.11"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"5.0.11","date":"2021-03-10","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"6.0.11","date":"2021-03-10","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.33408000000000004},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:4.0.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"redis","version":"4.0.14"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2021-21309","versionConstraint":">=

On startup, Redis begins listening on a Unix socket before adjusting its permissions to the user-provided configuration. If a permissive umask(2) is used, this creates a race condition that enables, during a short period of time, another process to establish an otherwise unauthorized connection. This problem has existed since Redis 2.6.0-RC1. This issue has been addressed in Redis versions 7.2.2, 7.0.14 and 6.2.14. Users are advised to upgrade.

NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"arm-security@arm.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.8,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":2.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4039","epss":0.00181,"percentile":0.40055,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4039","cwe":"CWE-693","source":"arm-security@arm.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-4039","cwe":"NVD-CWE-Other","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"10"},"package":{"name":"gcc-8","version":"8.3.0-6"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-4039","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"f6ea4c954058336d","name":"libstdc++6","version":"8.3.0-6","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:34b4fc871ab1cf2e528f564ec093aa4d8621f88cfc38a72c7c6ff8f6ecce1ce2","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/gcc-8-base/copyright","layerID":"sha256:c2adabaecedbda0af72b153c6499a0555f3a769d52370469d8f6bd6328af9b13","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libstdc++6/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libstdc++6:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:c2adabaecedbda0af72b153c6499a0555f3a769d52370469d8f6bd6328af9b13","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libstdc++6:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Artistic","GFDL-1.2","GPL","GPL-2","GPL-3","LGPL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libstdc\\+\\+6:libstdc\\+\\+6:8.3.0-6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libstdc%2B%2B6@8.3.0-6?arch=amd64&distro=debian-10&upstream=gcc-8","upstreams":[{"name":"gcc-8"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2020-10878","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-10878","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:10","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Perl before 5.30.3 has an integer overflow related to mishandling of a \"PL_regkind[OP(n)] == NOTHING\" situation.

In versions starting at 2.6 and prior to 7.4.3, An unauthenticated client can cause unlimited growth of output buffers, until the server runs out of memory or is killed. By default, the Redis configuration does not limit the output buffer of normal clients (see client-output-buffer-limit). Therefore, the output buffer can grow unlimitedly over time. As a result, the service is exhausted and the memory is unavailable. When password authentication is enabled on the Redis server, but no password is provided, the client can still cause the output buffer to grow from \"NOAUTH\" responses until the system will run out of memory. This issue has been patched in version 7.4.3. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable is to block access to prevent unauthenticated users from connecting to Redis. This can be done in different ways. Either using network access control tools like firewalls, iptables, security groups, etc, or enabling TLS and requiring users to authenticate using client side certificates.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-21605","epss":0.00107,"percentile":0.29644,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-21605","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["6.2.18","7.2.8","7.4.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"6.2.18","date":"2025-09-11","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"7.2.8","date":"2025-09-11","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"7.4.3","date":"2025-04-25","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.08025},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:4.0.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"redis","version":"4.0.14"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-21605","versionConstraint":">= 2.6, < 6.2.18,>= 7.0.0, < 7.2.8,>= 7.3, < 7.4.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.2.18"}},{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"stock-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:4.0.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"redis","version":"4.0.14"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-21605","versionConstraint":">= 2.6, < 6.2.18,>= 7.0.0, < 7.2.8,>= 7.3, < 7.4.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"6.2.18"}}],"artifact":{"id":"07ad6a4ae51cfdba","name":"redis","version":"4.0.14","type":"binary","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/redis-server","layerID":"sha256:34b4fc871ab1cf2e528f564ec093aa4d8621f88cfc38a72c7c6ff8f6ecce1ce2","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/redis-server","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:redislabs:redis:4.0.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redis:redis:4.0.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:generic/redis@4.0.14","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-48367","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-48367","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/redis/redis/commit/bde62951accfc4bb0a516276fd0b4b307e140ce2","https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/6.2.19","https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/7.2.10","https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/7.4.5","https://github.com/redis/redis/releases/tag/8.0.3","https://github.com/redis/redis/security/advisories/GHSA-4q32-c38c-pwgq"],"description":"Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk.
