In an extremely rare situation, the getaddrinfo function may access memory that has been freed, resulting in an application crash. This issue is only exploitable when a NSS module implements only the _nss_*_gethostbyname2_r and _nss_*_getcanonname_r hooks without implementing the _nss_*_gethostbyname3_r hook. The resolved name should return a large number of IPv6 and IPv4, and the call to the getaddrinfo function should have the AF_INET6 address family with AI_CANONNAME, AI_ALL and AI_V4MAPPED as flags.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","epss":0.01895,"percentile":0.82646,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-4806","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"18.04"},"package":{"name":"glibc","version":"2.27-3ubuntu1.6"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-4806","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"132864e20ea0db03","name":"libc6","version":"2.27-3ubuntu1.6","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:548a79621a426b4eb077c926eabac5a8620c454fb230640253e1b44dc7dd7562","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libc6/copyright","layerID":"sha256:548a79621a426b4eb077c926eabac5a8620c454fb230640253e1b44dc7dd7562","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libc6/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:548a79621a426b4eb077c926eabac5a8620c454fb230640253e1b44dc7dd7562","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:548a79621a426b4eb077c926eabac5a8620c454fb230640253e1b44dc7dd7562","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libc6:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["GPL-2","LGPL-2.1"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libc6:libc6:2.27-3ubuntu1.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/ubuntu/libc6@2.27-3ubuntu1.6?arch=amd64&distro=ubuntu-18.04&upstream=glibc","upstreams":[{"name":"glibc"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-0553","dataSource":"https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2024-0553","namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-0553","epss":0.01029,"percentile":0.76629,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-0553","cwe":"CWE-203","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-0553","cwe":"CWE-203","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":[],"state":"wont-fix"},"advisories":[],"risk":0.5145000000000001},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-0553","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0553","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0533","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0627","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0796","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1082","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1108","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1383","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2094","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-0553","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2258412","https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1522","https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnutls-help/2024-January/004841.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/19/3","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0533","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0627","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:0796","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1082","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1108","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:1383","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:2094","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2024-0553","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2258412","https://gitlab.com/gnutls/gnutls/-/issues/1522","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/02/msg00010.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/7ZEIOLORQ7N6WRPFXZSYDL2MC4LP7VFV/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/GNXKVR5YNUEBNHAHM5GSYKBZX4W2HMN2/","https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnutls-help/2024-January/004841.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240202-0011/"],"description":"A vulnerability was found in GnuTLS.

vulnerability was found in Perl. This security issue occurs while Perl for Windows relies on the system path environment variable to find the shell (`cmd.exe`). When running an executable that uses the Windows Perl interpreter, Perl attempts to find and execute `cmd.exe` within the operating system. However, due to path search order issues, Perl initially looks for cmd.exe in the current working directory. This flaw allows an attacker with limited privileges to place`cmd.exe` in locations with weak permissions, such as `C:\\ProgramData`. By doing so, arbitrary code can be executed when an administrator attempts to use this executable from these compromised locations.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.8,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-47039","epss":0.00073,"percentile":0.22613,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-47039","cwe":"CWE-122","source":"secalert@redhat.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-47039","cwe":"CWE-787","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"18.04"},"package":{"name":"perl","version":"5.26.1-6ubuntu0.7"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:18.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-47039","versionConstraint":"none
