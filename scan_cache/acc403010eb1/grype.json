Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a connection.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45288","epss":0.66635,"percentile":0.98456,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.21.9","1.22.2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.21.9","date":"2024-04-06","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.22.2","date":"2024-04-06","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":49.97625},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-45288","versionConstraint":"<

Backticks are used, since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being used inside of them (e.g. \"var a = {{.}}\"), since there is no obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1, with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped. This should be used with caution.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.8,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24538","epss":0.00646,"percentile":0.69926,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-24538","cwe":"CWE-94","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-24538","cwe":"CWE-94","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.19.8","1.20.3"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.19.8","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.20.3","date":"2023-04-18","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.60724},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-24538","versionConstraint":"< 1.19.8,>= 1.20.0, < 1.20.3 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.19.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"856ae5282dfeec9e","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:29698e3a4235cd86ecb9469b5d3482845d6457258676e331073ea6c36b0c9a8c","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.18.2","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.2","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-24791","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24791","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/591255","https://go.dev/issue/67555","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/t0rK-qHBqzY/m/6MMoAZkMAgAJ","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2963","https://go.dev/cl/591255","https://go.dev/issue/67555","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-dev/c/t0rK-qHBqzY/m/6MMoAZkMAgAJ","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2963","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20241004-0004/"],"description":"The net/http HTTP/1.1 client mishandled the case where a server responds to a request with an \"Expect: 100-continue\" header with a non-informational (200 or higher) status.

While the total number of entries in this cache is capped, an attacker sending very large keys can cause the server to allocate approximately 64 MiB per open connection.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41717","epss":0.00441,"percentile":0.62446,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-41717","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.18.9","1.19.4"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.18.9","date":"2022-12-14","kind":"first-observed"},{"version":"1.19.4","date":"2022-12-14","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.227115},"relatedVulnerabilities":[],"matchDetails":[{"type":"cpe-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"namespace":"nvd:cpe","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"package":{"name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-41717","versionConstraint":"< 1.18.9,>= 1.19.0, < 1.19.4 (unknown)","cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.18.9"}}],"artifact":{"id":"856ae5282dfeec9e","name":"stdlib","version":"go1.18.2","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","layerID":"sha256:29698e3a4235cd86ecb9469b5d3482845d6457258676e331073ea6c36b0c9a8c","accessPath":"/usr/local/bin/gosu","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":["BSD-3-Clause"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang:go:1.18.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/stdlib@1.18.2","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.18.2","architecture":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2023-45289","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45289","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/569340","https://go.dev/issue/65065","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2600","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0006/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/569340","https://go.dev/issue/65065","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/5pwGVUPoMbg","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2600","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240329-0006/"],"description":"When following an HTTP redirect to a domain which is not a subdomain match or exact match of the initial domain, an http.Client does not forward sensitive headers such as \"Authorization\" or \"Cookie\".

This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of service. This affects programs that use mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields.

Multipart form parsing with mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue, ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory parameter, and is documented as storing \"up to maxMemory bytes +10MB (reserved for non-file parts) in memory\". File parts which cannot be stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own. However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over 10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation states, \"If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will be an *os.File.\". This is no longer the case when a form contains more than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single file.

Chunk extensions are a little-used HTTP feature which permit including additional metadata in a request or response body sent using the chunked encoding.

First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of \"Member name contains '..'\" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain \"x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh\" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which \"tar xf\" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages). NOTE: the official GNU Tar manual has an otherwise-empty directory for each \"tar xf\" in its Security Rules of Thumb; however, third-party advice leads users to run \"tar xf\" more than once into the same directory.","cvss":[{"source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.1,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","epss":0.00049,"percentile":0.14932,"date":"2025-10-31"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-45582","cwe":"CWE-24","source":"cve@mitre.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"ubuntu","version":"22.04"},"package":{"name":"tar","version":"1.34+dfsg-1ubuntu0.1.22.04.2"},"namespace":"ubuntu:distro:ubuntu:22.04"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-45582","versionConstraint":"none

There is a side-channel in the P-364 curve that allows private key extraction (also, there is a dependency between the bit size of K and the size of the side channel). NOTE: This CVE is disputed because the OpenSSL security policy explicitly notes that any side channels which require same physical system to be detected are outside of the threat model for the software. The timing signal is so small that it is infeasible to be detected without having the attacking process running on the same physical
