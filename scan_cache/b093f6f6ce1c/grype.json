Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send.

The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45337","epss":0.42906,"percentile":0.97329,"date":"2025-11-13"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.14.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v778-237x-gjrc","versionConstraint":"<0.31.0 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.31.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"43758b61bf7aafaa","name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.14.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/loki","layerID":"sha256:7a3b663baeca60c4b9aea936d195535f8d1906f29f335bc4cce62fdee512f713","accessPath":"/usr/bin/loki","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:go:ssh:v0.14.0:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/crypto@v0.14.0","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.3","architecture":"amd64","mainModule":"github.com/grafana/loki"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-4v7x-pqxf-cx7m","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4v7x-pqxf-cx7m","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"net/http, x/net/http2: close connections when receiving too many headers","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45288","epss":0.64852,"percentile":0.98379,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.23.0"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"0.23.0","date":"2024-04-20","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":33.39878},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-45288","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45288","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/05/4","https://go.dev/cl/576155","https://go.dev/issue/65051","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/YgW0sx8mN3M","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QRYFHIQ6XRKRYBI2F5UESH67BJBQXUPT/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2687","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240419-0009/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/05/4","https://go.dev/cl/576155","https://go.dev/issue/65051","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/YgW0sx8mN3M","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QRYFHIQ6XRKRYBI2F5UESH67BJBQXUPT/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2687","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240419-0009/","https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/421644"],"description":"An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an\nempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to\nbe sent to the peer.\n\nImpact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences\nsuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they\nbecome

summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an\nempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to\nbe sent to the peer.\n\nImpact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences\nsuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they\nbecome available.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","epss":0.05822,"percentile":0.90122,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"apk-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"alpine","version":"3.18.5"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.1.4-r1"},"namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.18"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-5535","versionConstraint":"< 3.1.6-r0 (apk)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.1.6-r0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"93f93bdc542a2377","name":"libssl3","version":"3.1.4-r1","type":"apk","locations":[{"path":"/lib/apk/db/installed","layerID":"sha256:faa31947faf0e5471307f43e1810f298ab74ccbbfadac4687433773de130b689","accessPath":"/lib/apk/db/installed","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssl3:libssl3:3.1.4-r1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl3:libssl:3.1.4-r1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl:libssl3:3.1.4-r1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl:libssl:3.1.4-r1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libssl3@3.1.4-r1?arch=x86_64&distro=alpine-3.18.5&upstream=openssl","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl"}],"metadataType":"ApkMetadata","metadata":{"files":[{"path":"/lib"},{"path":"/lib/libssl.so.3"},{"path":"/usr"},{"path":"/usr/lib"},{"path":"/usr/lib/libssl.so.3"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-2511","dataSource":"https://security.alpinelinux.org/vuln/CVE-2024-2511","namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.18","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-2511","epss":0.03671,"percentile":0.874,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-2511","cwe":"CWE-1325","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["3.1.4-r6"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"3.1.4-r6","date":"2024-04-10","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":2.0006950000000003},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-2511","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-2511","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/7e4d731b1c07201ad9374c1cd9ac5263bdf35bce","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/b52867a9f618bb955bed2a3ce3db4d4f97ed8e5d","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e9d7083e241670332e0443da0f0d4ffb52829f08","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/5f8d25770ae6437db119dfc951e207271a326640","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240408.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/08/5","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/7e4d731b1c07201ad9374c1cd9ac5263bdf35bce","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/b52867a9f618bb955bed2a3ce3db4d4f97ed8e5d","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e9d7083e241670332e0443da0f0d4ffb52829f08","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/5f8d25770ae6437db119dfc951e207271a326640","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/10/msg00033.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/11/msg00000.html","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240503-0013/","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240408.txt"],"description":"Issue summary: Some non-default TLS server configurations can cause unbounded\nmemory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions\n\nImpact summary: An attacker may exploit certain server configurations to trigger\nunbounded memory growth that would lead to a Denial of Service\n\nThis problem can occur in TLSv1.3 if the non-default SSL_OP_NO_TICKET option is\nbeing used (but not if early_data support is also configured and the default\nanti-replay protection is in use).

However\nwe are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be affected\nby this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity security issue.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4.3},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":4.3},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-6129","epss":0.01861,"percentile":0.82488,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-6129","cwe":"CWE-440","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-6129","cwe":"CWE-787","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"apk-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"alpine","version":"3.18.5"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.1.4-r1"},"namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.18"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-6129","versionConstraint":"< 3.1.4-r3 (apk)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.1.4-r3"}}],"artifact":{"id":"93f93bdc542a2377","name":"libssl3","version":"3.1.4-r1","type":"apk","locations":[{"path":"/lib/apk/db/installed","layerID":"sha256:faa31947faf0e5471307f43e1810f298ab74ccbbfadac4687433773de130b689","accessPath":"/lib/apk/db/installed","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssl3:libssl3:3.1.4-r1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl3:libssl:3.1.4-r1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl:libssl3:3.1.4-r1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl:libssl:3.1.4-r1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libssl3@3.1.4-r1?arch=x86_64&distro=alpine-3.18.5&upstream=openssl","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl"}],"metadataType":"ApkMetadata","metadata":{"files":[{"path":"/lib"},{"path":"/lib/libssl.so.3"},{"path":"/usr"},{"path":"/usr/lib"},{"path":"/usr/lib/libssl.so.3"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-v86x-5fm3-5p7j","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v86x-5fm3-5p7j","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Alertmanager UI is vulnerable to stored XSS via the /api/v1/alerts endpoint","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":2.8},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-40577","epss":0.01994,"percentile":0.83059,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-40577","cwe":"CWE-79","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.25.1"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"0.25.1","date":"2023-08-24","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":1.03688},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-40577","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-40577","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/security/advisories/GHSA-v86x-5fm3-5p7j","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00011.html","https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/security/advisories/GHSA-v86x-5fm3-5p7j","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00011.html"],"description":"Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server.

Again a call to SSL_free_buffers will succeed even though the buffer\nis still in use.\n\nWhile these scenarios could occur accidentally during normal operation a\nmalicious attacker could attempt to engineer a stituation where this occurs.\nWe are not aware of this issue being actively exploited.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4741","epss":0.00238,"percentile":0.46852,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4741","cwe":"CWE-416","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"apk-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"alpine","version":"3.18.5"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.1.4-r1"},"namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.18"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-4741","versionConstraint":"< 3.1.6-r0 (apk)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.1.6-r0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"93f93bdc542a2377","name":"libssl3","version":"3.1.4-r1","type":"apk","locations":[{"path":"/lib/apk/db/installed","layerID":"sha256:faa31947faf0e5471307f43e1810f298ab74ccbbfadac4687433773de130b689","accessPath":"/lib/apk/db/installed","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssl3:libssl3:3.1.4-r1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl3:libssl:3.1.4-r1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl:libssl3:3.1.4-r1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl:libssl:3.1.4-r1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libssl3@3.1.4-r1?arch=x86_64&distro=alpine-3.18.5&upstream=openssl","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl"}],"metadataType":"ApkMetadata","metadata":{"files":[{"path":"/lib"},{"path":"/lib/libssl.so.3"},{"path":"/usr"},{"path":"/usr/lib"},{"path":"/usr/lib/libssl.so.3"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-8r3f-844c-mc37","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8r3f-844c-mc37","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"Golang protojson.Unmarshal function infinite loop when unmarshaling certain forms of invalid JSON","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-24786","epss":0.00231,"percentile":0.45879,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.33.0"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.33.0","date":"2024-03-14","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.144375},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-24786","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-24786","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/569356","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JDMBHAVSDU2FBDZ45U3A2VLSM35OJ2HU/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2611","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240517-0002/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/03/08/4","https://go.dev/cl/569356","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JDMBHAVSDU2FBDZ45U3A2VLSM35OJ2HU/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2611","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240517-0002/"],"description":"The protojson.Unmarshal function can enter an infinite loop when unmarshaling certain forms of invalid JSON.

The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but\nOpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference that results in OpenSSL crashing.

summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL\nto crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack\n\nImpact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted\nsources might terminate abruptly.\n\nA file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an\nuntrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but\nOpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer\ndereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12\nfiles from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will\nbe vulnerable to this issue.\n\nOpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),\nPKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes()\nand PKCS12_newpass().\n\nWe have also fixed a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this\nfunction is related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this

summary: Checking excessively long DSA keys or parameters may be very\nslow.\n\nImpact summary: Applications that use the functions EVP_PKEY_param_check()\nor EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check a DSA public key or DSA parameters may\nexperience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked\nhave been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of\nService.\n\nThe functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() perform\nvarious checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long time\nif the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.\n\nTrying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow using\npublic keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signature\nverification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limit\nthe modulus size when performing the checks.\n\nAn application that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()\nand supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be\nvulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.\n\nThese functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys so\nonly applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.\n\nAlso vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applications\nwhen using the `-check` option.\n\nThe OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.\n\nThe OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4603","epss":0.00092,"percentile":0.2655,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-4603","cwe":"CWE-606","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2024-4603","cwe":"CWE-834","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"apk-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"alpine","version":"3.18.5"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.1.4-r1"},"namespace":"alpine:distro:alpine:3.18"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-4603","versionConstraint":"< 3.1.5-r0 (apk)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.1.5-r0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"93f93bdc542a2377","name":"libssl3","version":"3.1.4-r1","type":"apk","locations":[{"path":"/lib/apk/db/installed","layerID":"sha256:faa31947faf0e5471307f43e1810f298ab74ccbbfadac4687433773de130b689","accessPath":"/lib/apk/db/installed","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Apache-2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libssl3:libssl3:3.1.4-r1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl3:libssl:3.1.4-r1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl:libssl3:3.1.4-r1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libssl:libssl:3.1.4-r1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:apk/alpine/libssl3@3.1.4-r1?arch=x86_64&distro=alpine-3.18.5&upstream=openssl","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl"}],"metadataType":"ApkMetadata","metadata":{"files":[{"path":"/lib"},{"path":"/lib/libssl.so.3"},{"path":"/usr"},{"path":"/usr/lib"},{"path":"/usr/lib/libssl.so.3"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-mh63-6h87-95cp","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mh63-6h87-95cp","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"jwt-go allows excessive memory allocation during header parsing","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-30204","epss":0.00055,"percentile":0.17215,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-30204","cwe":"CWE-405","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["4.5.2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"4.5.2","date":"2025-03-22","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.04125},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-30204","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30204","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/commit/0951d184286dece21f73c85673fd308786ffe9c3","https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/commit/bf316c48137a1212f8d0af9288cc9ce8e59f1afb","https://github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/security/advisories/GHSA-mh63-6h87-95cp","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250404-0002/"],"description":"golang-jwt is a Go implementation of JSON Web Tokens.

Unclear documentation of the error behavior in `ParseWithClaims` can lead to situation where users are potentially not checking errors in the way they should be. Especially, if a token is both expired and invalid, the errors returned by `ParseWithClaims` return both error codes. If users only check for the `jwt.ErrTokenExpired ` using `error.Is`, they will ignore the embedded `jwt.ErrTokenSignatureInvalid` and thus potentially accept invalid tokens. A fix has been back-ported with the error handling logic from the `v5` branch to the `v4` branch. In this logic, the `ParseWithClaims` function will immediately return in \"dangerous\" situations (e.g., an invalid signature), limiting the combined errors only to situations where the signature is valid, but further validation failed (e.g., if the signature is valid, but is expired AND has the wrong audience). This fix is part of the 4.5.1 release. We are aware that this changes the behaviour of an established function and is not 100 % backwards compatible, so updating to 4.5.1 might break your code. In case you cannot update to 4.5.0, please make sure that you are properly checking for all errors (\"dangerous\" ones first), so that you are not running in the case detailed above.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":3.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-51744","epss":0.00027,"percentile":0.06535,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-51744","cwe":"CWE-755","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v4","version":"v4.5.0"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-29wx-vh33-7x7r","versionConstraint":"<4.5.1 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.5.1"}}],"artifact":{"id":"72bf720152b8604b","name":"github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v4","version":"v4.5.0","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/usr/bin/loki","layerID":"sha256:7a3b663baeca60c4b9aea936d195535f8d1906f29f335bc4cce62fdee512f713","accessPath":"/usr/bin/loki","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:golang-jwt:jwt\\/v4:v4.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:golang_jwt:jwt\\/v4:v4.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:golang:jwt\\/v4:v4.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/github.com/golang-jwt/jwt@v4.5.0#v4","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.21.3","architecture":"amd64","mainModule":"github.com/grafana/loki"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-22866","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-22866","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["https://go.dev/cl/643735","https://go.dev/issue/71383","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/xU1ZCHUZw3k","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2025-3447","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20250221-0002/"],"description":"Due to the usage of a variable time instruction in the assembly implementation of an internal function, a small number of bits of secret scalars are leaked on the ppc64le architecture.
