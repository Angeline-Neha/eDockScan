The documentation for ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback says that \"A call to this function does not guarantee that the key offered is in fact used to authenticate.\" Specifically, the SSH protocol allows clients to inquire about whether a public key is acceptable before proving control of the corresponding private key. PublicKeyCallback may be called with multiple keys, and the order in which the keys were provided cannot be used to infer which key the client successfully authenticated with, if any. Some applications, which store the key(s) passed to PublicKeyCallback (or derived information) and make security relevant determinations based on it once the connection is established, may make incorrect assumptions. For example, an attacker may send public keys A and B, and then authenticate with A. PublicKeyCallback would be called only twice, first with A and then with B. A vulnerable application may then make authorization decisions based on key B for which the attacker does not actually control the private key. Since this API is widely misused, as a partial mitigation golang.org/x/cry...@v0.31.0 enforces the property that, when successfully authenticating via public key, the last key passed to ServerConfig.PublicKeyCallback will be the key used to authenticate the connection. PublicKeyCallback will now be called multiple times with the same key, if necessary. Note that the client may still not control the last key passed to PublicKeyCallback if the connection is then authenticated with a different method, such as PasswordCallback, KeyboardInteractiveCallback, or NoClientAuth. Users should be using the Extensions field of the Permissions return value from the various authentication callbacks to record data associated with the authentication attempt instead of referencing external state. Once the connection is established the state corresponding to the successful authentication attempt can be retrieved via the ServerConn.Permissions field. Note that some third-party libraries misuse the Permissions type by sharing it across authentication attempts; users of third-party libraries should refer to the relevant projects for guidance.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-45337","epss":0.42906,"percentile":0.97329,"date":"2025-11-13"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.0.0-20210817164053-32db794688a5"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-v778-237x-gjrc","versionConstraint":"<0.31.0 (go)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"0.31.0"}}],"artifact":{"id":"93839c31c7b989e5","name":"golang.org/x/crypto","version":"v0.0.0-20210817164053-32db794688a5","type":"go-module","locations":[{"path":"/bin/drone-server","layerID":"sha256:eb79fa576b99886e8c35dcf455f8450147f1f97a61266310aa7cce7e38e0391e","accessPath":"/bin/drone-server","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"go","licenses":[],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:go:ssh:v0.0.0-20210817164053-32db794688a5:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:golang/golang.org/x/crypto@v0.0.0-20210817164053-32db794688a5","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"GolangBinMetadata","metadata":{"goCompiledVersion":"go1.22.7","architecture":"amd64","h1Digest":"h1:HWj/xjIHfjYU5nVXpTM0s39J9CbLn7Cc5a7IC5rwsMQ=","mainModule":"github.com/drone/drone"}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-4v7x-pqxf-cx7m","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4v7x-pqxf-cx7m","namespace":"github:language:go","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"net/http, x/net/http2: close connections when receiving too many headers","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-45288","epss":0.64852,"percentile":0.98379,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"fix":{"versions":["0.23.0"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"0.23.0","date":"2024-04-20","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":33.39878},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-45288","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45288","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/05/4","https://go.dev/cl/576155","https://go.dev/issue/65051","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/YgW0sx8mN3M","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QRYFHIQ6XRKRYBI2F5UESH67BJBQXUPT/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2687","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240419-0009/","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/03/16","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/04/05/4","https://go.dev/cl/576155","https://go.dev/issue/65051","https://groups.google.com/g/golang-announce/c/YgW0sx8mN3M","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QRYFHIQ6XRKRYBI2F5UESH67BJBQXUPT/","https://pkg.go.dev/vuln/GO-2024-2687","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240419-0009/","https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/421644"],"description":"An attacker may cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data by sending an excessive number of CONTINUATION frames. Maintaining HPACK state requires parsing and processing all HEADERS and CONTINUATION frames on a connection. When a request's headers exceed MaxHeaderBytes, no memory is allocated to store the excess headers, but they are still parsed. This permits an attacker to cause an HTTP/2 endpoint to read arbitrary amounts of header data, all associated with a request which is going to be rejected. These headers can include Huffman-encoded data which is significantly more expensive for the receiver to decode than for an attacker to send. The fix sets a limit on the amount of excess header frames we will process before closing a

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","epss":0.0015,"percentile":0.36138,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-39325","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"go-module-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"go","namespace":"github:language:go","package":{"name":"golang.org/x/net","version":"v0.0.0-20211216030914-fe4d6282115f"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-4374-p667-p6c8","versionConstraint":"<0.17.0

This could cause unexpected behavior for environments that require containers to run as a non-root user. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.38, 1.7.27, and 2.04.

This issue is fixed in versions 1.7.29, 2.0.7, 2.1.5 and 2.2.0.
