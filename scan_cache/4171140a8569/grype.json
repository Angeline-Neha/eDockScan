OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to translate an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using the OpenSSL type ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form, which are the sub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal form, separated by periods.  When one of the sub-identifiers in the OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large (these are sizes that are seen as absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds of KiBs), the translation to a decimal number in text may take a very long time.  The time complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the sub-identifiers in bytes (*).  With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms using names / identifiers in string form was introduced.  This includes using OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers for fetching algorithms.  Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received through the ASN.1 structure AlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly used in multiple protocols to specify what cryptographic algorithm should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or decrypt, or digest passed data.  Applications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted data are affected, with any version of OpenSSL.  If the use is for the mere purpose of display, the severity is considered low.  In OpenSSL 3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS.  It also impacts anything that processes X.509 certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.  The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL have a 100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain.  Additionally, this only impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled client authentication.  In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects displaying diverse objects, such as X.509 certificates.  This is assumed to not happen in such a way that it would cause a Denial of Service, so these versions are considered not affected by this issue in such a way that it would be cause for concern, and the severity is therefore considered low.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":6.5,"exploitabilityScore":2.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-2650","epss":0.9197,"percentile":0.99688,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-2650","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-2650","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.1.1n-0+deb11u5"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u5","date":"2023-05-31","kind":"advisory"}]},"advisories":[{"id":"DSA-5417-1","link":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DSA-5417-1"}],"risk":52.88274999999999},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-2650","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-2650","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/05/30/1","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=423a2bc737a908ad0c77bda470b2b59dc879936b","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=853c5e56ee0b8650c73140816bb8b91d6163422c","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9e209944b35cf82368071f160a744b6178f9b098","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db779b0e10b047f2585615e0b8f2acdf21f8544a","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00011.html","https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0009","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230703-0001/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0009/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5417","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230530.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/05/30/1","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=423a2bc737a908ad0c77bda470b2b59dc879936b","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=853c5e56ee0b8650c73140816bb8b91d6163422c","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=9e209944b35cf82368071f160a744b6178f9b098","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=db779b0e10b047f2585615e0b8f2acdf21f8544a","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00011.html","https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2023-0009","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230703-0001/","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20231027-0009/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5417","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230530.txt"],"description":"Issue summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object identifiers or\ndata containing them may be very slow.\n\nImpact summary: Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly, or use any of\nthe OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no message\nsize limit may experience notable to very long delays when processing those\nmessages, which may lead to a Denial of Service.\n\nAn OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers -\nmost of which have no size limit.

The RFC 5155 specification implies that an algorithm must perform thousands of iterations of a hash function in certain situations.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-50868","epss":0.4556,"percentile":0.97484,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-50868","cwe":"CWE-400","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"systemd","version":"247.3-7"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-50868","versionConstraint":"< 247.3-7+deb11u6 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"247.3-7+deb11u6"}}],"artifact":{"id":"c78a26067c0102ee","name":"libudev1","version":"247.3-7","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:b626401ef603dd383fc3a43cf474186827db1875591bfc84b178177ca010015b","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libudev1/copyright","layerID":"sha256:9c742cd6c7a5752ee36be8ecb14be45c0885e10e6dd34f26a9ae3eb096c5d492","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libudev1/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libudev1:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:9c742cd6c7a5752ee36be8ecb14be45c0885e10e6dd34f26a9ae3eb096c5d492","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libudev1:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["CC0-1.0","Expat","GPL-2","GPL-2+","LGPL-2.1","LGPL-2.1+","public-domain"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libudev1:libudev1:247.3-7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libudev1@247.3-7?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11&upstream=systemd","upstreams":[{"name":"systemd"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-26465","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2025-26465","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"A vulnerability was found in OpenSSH when the VerifyHostKeyDNS option is enabled.

As a workaround, avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":8.1,"exploitabilityScore":1.5,"impactScore":6.1},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-32004","epss":0.08571,"percentile":0.9204,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-32004","cwe":"CWE-114","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"git","version":"1:2.30.2-1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-32004","versionConstraint":"< 1:2.30.2-1+deb11u3 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1:2.30.2-1+deb11u3"}}],"artifact":{"id":"eb059f66a8023c6e","name":"git-man","version":"1:2.30.2-1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:b626401ef603dd383fc3a43cf474186827db1875591bfc84b178177ca010015b","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/git-man/copyright","layerID":"sha256:9b55156abf262eac3e6bd3ae60e7277ab4f9c69543650d7ecefc8c26ee889873","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/git-man/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/git-man.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:9b55156abf262eac3e6bd3ae60e7277ab4f9c69543650d7ecefc8c26ee889873","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/git-man.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/git-man.list","layerID":"sha256:9b55156abf262eac3e6bd3ae60e7277ab4f9c69543650d7ecefc8c26ee889873","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/git-man.list"}],"language":"","licenses":["Apache-2.0","Artistic","Boost","EDL-1.0","Expat","GPL","GPL-1+","GPL-2","GPL-2+","ISC","LGPL-2","LGPL-2+","LGPL-2.1","LGPL-2.1+","dlmalloc","mingw-runtime"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:git-man:git-man:1\\:2.30.2-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:git-man:git_man:1\\:2.30.2-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:git_man:git-man:1\\:2.30.2-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:git_man:git_man:1\\:2.30.2-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:git:git-man:1\\:2.30.2-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:git:git_man:1\\:2.30.2-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/git-man@1%3A2.30.2-1?arch=all&distro=debian-11&upstream=git","upstreams":[{"name":"git"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-28085","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2024-28085","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"wall in util-linux through 2.40, often installed with setgid tty permissions, allows escape sequences to be sent to other users' terminals through argv.

Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling application.  The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports that there was no overlap in the lists).  This function is typically called from a server side application callback for ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\" response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it will be vulnerable to this problem.  In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of confidentiality will occur.  This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error. Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active exploitation unlikely.  The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.  Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they become available.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","epss":0.03414,"percentile":0.86988,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.1.1w-0+deb11u2"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.1.1w-0+deb11u2","date":"2024-11-27","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":3.08967},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2024-5535","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-5535","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Critical","urls":["https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4ada436a1946cbb24db5ab4ca082b69c1bc10f37","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/99fb785a5f85315b95288921a321a935ea29a51e","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/cf6f91f6121f4db167405db2f0de410a456f260c","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e86ac436f0bd54d4517745483e2315650fae7b2c","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/9947251413065a05189a63c9b7a6c1d4e224c21c","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/b78ec0824da857223486660177d3b1f255c65d87","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240627.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/27/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/06/28/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/08/15/1","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/4ada436a1946cbb24db5ab4ca082b69c1bc10f37","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/99fb785a5f85315b95288921a321a935ea29a51e","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/cf6f91f6121f4db167405db2f0de410a456f260c","https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/e86ac436f0bd54d4517745483e2315650fae7b2c","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/9947251413065a05189a63c9b7a6c1d4e224c21c","https://github.openssl.org/openssl/extended-releases/commit/b78ec0824da857223486660177d3b1f255c65d87","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240712-0005/","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20240627.txt"],"description":"Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an\nempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to\nbe sent to the peer.\n\nImpact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences\nsuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash.

Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling application.  The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN (Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports that there was no overlap in the lists).  This function is typically called from a server side application callback for ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\" response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it will be vulnerable to this problem.  In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length. However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of confidentiality will occur.  This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error. Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active exploitation unlikely.  The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.  Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of OpenSSL at this time.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms.

doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle

This can be done either by having the victim clone a malicious repository on the same machine, or having them clone a malicious repository embedded as a bare repository via a submodule from any source, provided they clone with the `--recurse-submodules` option. Git does not create symbolic links in the `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory. The problem has been patched in the versions published on 2022-10-18, and backported to v2.30.x. Potential workarounds: Avoid cloning untrusted repositories using the `--local` optimization when on a shared machine, either by passing the `--no-local` option to `git clone` or cloning from a URL that uses the `file://` scheme. Alternatively, avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules` or run `git config --global protocol.file.allow user`.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.5,"exploitabilityScore":1.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-39253","epss":0.02477,"percentile":0.84795,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-39253","cwe":"CWE-200","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-39253","cwe":"CWE-59","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1:2.30.2-1+deb11u1"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1:2.30.2-1+deb11u1","date":"2023-01-29","kind":"advisory"}]},"advisories":[{"id":"DSA-5332-1","link":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DSA-5332-1"}],"risk":1.300425},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2022-39253","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-39253","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Nov/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/02/14/5","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/14/2","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-3wp6-j8xr-qw85","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00025.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/C7B6JPKX5CGGLAHXJVQMIZNNEEB72FHD/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JMQWGMDLX6KTVWW5JZLVPI7ICAK72TN7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OHNO2FB55CPX47BAXMBWUBGWHO6N6ZZH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UKFHE4KVD7EKS5J3KTDFVBEKU3CLXGVV/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VFYXCTLOSESYIP72BUYD6ECDIMUM4WMB/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213496","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Nov/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/02/14/5","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/05/14/2","https://github.com/git/git/security/advisories/GHSA-3wp6-j8xr-qw85","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00025.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/C7B6JPKX5CGGLAHXJVQMIZNNEEB72FHD/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/JMQWGMDLX6KTVWW5JZLVPI7ICAK72TN7/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OHNO2FB55CPX47BAXMBWUBGWHO6N6ZZH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/UKFHE4KVD7EKS5J3KTDFVBEKU3CLXGVV/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VFYXCTLOSESYIP72BUYD6ECDIMUM4WMB/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202312-15","https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213496"],"description":"Git is an open source, scalable, distributed revision control system.

By recovering the secret from the ClientKeyExchange message, the attacker would be able to decrypt the application data exchanged over that connection.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":7.4,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-0361","epss":0.01198,"percentile":0.78342,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-0361","cwe":"CWE-203","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2023-0361","cwe":"CWE-203","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"gnutls28","version":"3.7.1-5+deb11u1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2023-0361","versionConstraint":"< 3.7.1-5+deb11u3 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.7.1-5+deb11u3"}}],"artifact":{"id":"45fab5567bfe256a","name":"libgnutls30","version":"3.7.1-5+deb11u1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:b626401ef603dd383fc3a43cf474186827db1875591bfc84b178177ca010015b","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/libgnutls30/copyright","layerID":"sha256:9c742cd6c7a5752ee36be8ecb14be45c0885e10e6dd34f26a9ae3eb096c5d492","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/libgnutls30/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libgnutls30:amd64.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:9c742cd6c7a5752ee36be8ecb14be45c0885e10e6dd34f26a9ae3eb096c5d492","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/libgnutls30:amd64.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}}],"language":"","licenses":["Apache-2.0","BSD-3-Clause","CC0","Expat","GFDL-1.3","GPL","GPL-3","GPLv3+","LGPL","LGPL-3","LGPLv2.1+","LGPLv3+_or_GPLv2+","The"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:libgnutls30:libgnutls30:3.7.1-5\\+deb11u1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/libgnutls30@3.7.1-5%2Bdeb11u1?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11&upstream=gnutls28","upstreams":[{"name":"gnutls28"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2016-20012","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-20012","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"Negligible","urls":[],"description":"OpenSSH through 8.7 allows remote attackers, who have a suspicion that a certain combination of username and public key is known to an SSH server, to test whether this suspicion is correct.

In versions prior to 2.30.6, 2.31.5, 2.32.4, 2.33.5, 2.34.5, 2.35.5, 2.36.3, and 2.37.4, the function that splits the command arguments into an array improperly uses an `int` to represent the number of entries in the array, allowing a malicious actor to intentionally overflow the return value, leading to arbitrary heap writes. Because the resulting array is then passed to `execv()`, it is possible to leverage this attack to gain remote code execution on a victim machine.

summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be very slow.  Impact summary: Applications that use the functions DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.  The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length.  However the DH_check() function checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters that have been supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if it has already been found to be too large.  An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack.  The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and EVP_PKEY_param_check().  Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the '-check' option.

Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL and are not commonly used by applications.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-0466","epss":0.00666,"percentile":0.70629,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2023-0466","cwe":"CWE-295","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}],"fix":{"versions":["1.1.1n-0+deb11u5"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u5","date":"2023-05-31","kind":"advisory"}]},"advisories":[{"id":"DSA-5417-1","link":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/DSA-5417-1"}],"risk":0.34299},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2023-0466","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-0466","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Medium","urls":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/28/4","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=0d16b7e99aafc0b4a6d729eec65a411a7e025f0a","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=51e8a84ce742db0f6c70510d0159dad8f7825908","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=73398dea26de9899fb4baa94098ad0a61f435c72","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=fc814a30fc4f0bc54fcea7d9a7462f5457aab061","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00011.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230414-0001/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5417","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230328.txt","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/28/4","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=0d16b7e99aafc0b4a6d729eec65a411a7e025f0a","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=51e8a84ce742db0f6c70510d0159dad8f7825908","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=73398dea26de9899fb4baa94098ad0a61f435c72","https://git.openssl.org/gitweb/?p=openssl.git;a=commitdiff;h=fc814a30fc4f0bc54fcea7d9a7462f5457aab061","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/06/msg00011.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202402-08","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20230414-0001/","https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5417","https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230328.txt"],"description":"The function X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() is documented to\nimplicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate\nverification.

summary: Use of the low-level GF(2^m) elliptic curve APIs with untrusted explicit values for the field polynomial can lead to out-of-bounds memory reads or writes.  Impact summary: Out of bound memory writes can lead to an application crash or even a possibility of a remote code execution, however, in all the protocols involving Elliptic Curve Cryptography that we're aware of, either only \"named curves\" are supported, or, if explicit curve parameters are supported, they specify an X9.62 encoding of binary (GF(2^m)) curves that can't represent problematic input values. Thus the likelihood of existence of a vulnerable application is low.  In particular, the X9.62 encoding is used for ECC keys in X.509 certificates, so problematic inputs cannot occur in the context of processing X.509 certificates.  Any problematic use-cases would have to be using an \"exotic\" curve encoding.  The affected APIs include: EC_GROUP_new_curve_GF2m(), EC_GROUP_new_from_params(), and various supporting BN_GF2m_*() functions.  Applications working with \"exotic\" explicit binary (GF(2^m)) curve parameters, that make it possible to represent invalid field polynomials with a zero constant term, via the above or similar APIs, may terminate abruptly as a result of reading or writing outside of array bounds.

This vulnerability could lead to FTP client scanning ports, which otherwise would not have been possible.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":1.5},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-4189","epss":0.00411,"percentile":0.60859,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2021-4189","cwe":"CWE-252","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"python3.9","version":"3.9.2-1"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2021-4189","versionConstraint":"< 3.9.2-1+deb11u2 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.9.2-1+deb11u2"}}],"artifact":{"id":"47f1d0acc088f0d7","name":"python3.9-minimal","version":"3.9.2-1","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:b626401ef603dd383fc3a43cf474186827db1875591bfc84b178177ca010015b","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/python3.9-minimal/copyright","layerID":"sha256:9b55156abf262eac3e6bd3ae60e7277ab4f9c69543650d7ecefc8c26ee889873","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/python3.9-minimal/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.9-minimal.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:9b55156abf262eac3e6bd3ae60e7277ab4f9c69543650d7ecefc8c26ee889873","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.9-minimal.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.9-minimal.list","layerID":"sha256:9b55156abf262eac3e6bd3ae60e7277ab4f9c69543650d7ecefc8c26ee889873","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.9-minimal.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.9-minimal.postinst","layerID":"sha256:9b55156abf262eac3e6bd3ae60e7277ab4f9c69543650d7ecefc8c26ee889873","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.9-minimal.postinst"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.9-minimal.postrm","layerID":"sha256:9b55156abf262eac3e6bd3ae60e7277ab4f9c69543650d7ecefc8c26ee889873","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.9-minimal.postrm"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.9-minimal.preinst","layerID":"sha256:9b55156abf262eac3e6bd3ae60e7277ab4f9c69543650d7ecefc8c26ee889873","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.9-minimal.preinst"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.9-minimal.prerm","layerID":"sha256:9b55156abf262eac3e6bd3ae60e7277ab4f9c69543650d7ecefc8c26ee889873","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/python3.9-minimal.prerm"}],"language":"","licenses":["By","GPL-2","Permission","Redistribution","This"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python3.9-minimal:python3.9-minimal:3.9.2-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3.9-minimal:python3.9_minimal:3.9.2-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3.9_minimal:python3.9-minimal:3.9.2-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3.9_minimal:python3.9_minimal:3.9.2-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3.9:python3.9-minimal:3.9.2-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3.9:python3.9_minimal:3.9.2-1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/python3.9-minimal@3.9.2-1?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11&upstream=python3.9","upstreams":[{"name":"python3.9"}]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-2097","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-2097","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"Medium","urls":[],"description":"AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances.

Where the key or parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service.  The function DH_check() performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446 it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger an overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus it is unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p.  An application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.  The function DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and EVP_PKEY_param_check().  Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using the \"-check\" option.

This vulnerability affects users working on multi-user machines, where untrusted parties have write access to the same hard disk. Those untrusted parties could create the folder `C:\\.git`, which would be picked up by Git operations run supposedly outside a repository while searching for a Git directory. Git would then respect any config in said Git directory. Git Bash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE` are vulnerable as well. Users who installed posh-gitare vulnerable simply by starting a PowerShell.

It is primarily used internally to OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities, but may also be called directly by end user applications.  The function receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure. However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most likely result in a crash.    This scenario occurs directly in the internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on the BIO. This internal function is in turn called by the public API functions PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream, PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream, SMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and SMIME_write_PKCS7.  Other public API functions that may be impacted by this include i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7, i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream.

If the function succeeds then the \"name_out\", \"header\" and \"data\" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0 bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service attack.  The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are also directly affected.  These functions are also called indirectly by a number of other OpenSSL functions including PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which are also vulnerable.

After a\nsufficiently large number of messages the attacker could recover the pre-master\nsecret used for the original connection and thus be able to decrypt the\napplication data sent over that connection.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.9,"exploitabilityScore":2.3,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-4304","epss":0.00177,"percentile":0.39732,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2022-4304","cwe":"CWE-203","source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary"},{"cve":"CVE-2022-4304","cwe":"CWE-203","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u3"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2022-4304","versionConstraint":"< 1.1.1n-0+deb11u4 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u4"}}],"artifact":{"id":"8170614b75c9eae6","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u3","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:b626401ef603dd383fc3a43cf474186827db1875591bfc84b178177ca010015b","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","layerID":"sha256:03127cdb479b0f1eb8a9b0df8e8d72ead24979728d3c84ff645611b9d8790f94","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:03127cdb479b0f1eb8a9b0df8e8d72ead24979728d3c84ff645611b9d8790f94","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:03127cdb479b0f1eb8a9b0df8e8d72ead24979728d3c84ff645611b9d8790f94","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list","layerID":"sha256:03127cdb479b0f1eb8a9b0df8e8d72ead24979728d3c84ff645611b9d8790f94","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst","layerID":"sha256:03127cdb479b0f1eb8a9b0df8e8d72ead24979728d3c84ff645611b9d8790f94","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst"}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1n-0\\+deb11u3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openssl@1.1.1n-0%2Bdeb11u3?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2024-21208","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-21208","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"Low","urls":["https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2024.html"],"description":"Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: Networking).

is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. Git defines a line-based protocol that is used to exchange information between Git and Git credential helpers. Some ecosystems (most notably, .NET and node.js) interpret single Carriage Return characters as newlines, which renders the protections against CVE-2020-5260 incomplete for credential helpers that treat Carriage Returns in this way.

summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead OpenSSL to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack  Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from untrusted sources might terminate abruptly.  A file in PKCS12 format can contain certificates and keys and may come from an untrusted source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an application processes PKCS12 files from an untrusted source using the OpenSSL APIs then that application will be vulnerable to this issue.

issue was discovered in Python before 3.11.1. An unnecessary quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response with status code 302.

For that reason\nthe severity of this vulnerability is Low.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.1,"exploitabilityScore":0.7,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-13176","epss":0.00118,"percentile":0.31586,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-13176","cwe":"CWE-385","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u3"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2024-13176","versionConstraint":"< 1.1.1w-0+deb11u3 (deb)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"1.1.1w-0+deb11u3"}}],"artifact":{"id":"8170614b75c9eae6","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u3","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:b626401ef603dd383fc3a43cf474186827db1875591bfc84b178177ca010015b","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","layerID":"sha256:03127cdb479b0f1eb8a9b0df8e8d72ead24979728d3c84ff645611b9d8790f94","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:03127cdb479b0f1eb8a9b0df8e8d72ead24979728d3c84ff645611b9d8790f94","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:03127cdb479b0f1eb8a9b0df8e8d72ead24979728d3c84ff645611b9d8790f94","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list","layerID":"sha256:03127cdb479b0f1eb8a9b0df8e8d72ead24979728d3c84ff645611b9d8790f94","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst","layerID":"sha256:03127cdb479b0f1eb8a9b0df8e8d72ead24979728d3c84ff645611b9d8790f94","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst"}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1n-0\\+deb11u3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openssl@1.1.1n-0%2Bdeb11u3?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2021-22898","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-22898","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"Low","urls":[],"description":"curl 7.7 through 7.76.1 suffers from an information disclosure when the `-t` command line option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS` in libcurl, is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers.

Using a specially-crafted repository, Git prior to versions 2.39.2, 2.38.4, 2.37.6, 2.36.5, 2.35.7, 2.34.7, 2.33.7, 2.32.6, 2.31.7, and 2.30.8 can be tricked into using its local clone optimization even when using a non-local transport. Though Git will abort local clones whose source `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory contains symbolic links, the `objects` directory itself may still be a symbolic link. These two may be combined to include arbitrary files based on known paths on the victim's filesystem within the malicious repository's working copy, allowing for data exfiltration in a similar manner as CVE-2022-39253.\n\nA fix has been prepared and will appear in v2.39.2 v2.38.4 v2.37.6 v2.36.5 v2.35.7 v2.34.7 v2.33.7 v2.32.6, v2.31.7 and v2.30.8.

The timing signal is so small that it is infeasible to be detected without having the attacking process running on the same physical system.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":5.3,"exploitabilityScore":1.7,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27587","epss":0.00035,"percentile":0.09328,"date":"2025-11-01"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-27587","cwe":"CWE-385","source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"dpkg-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"debian","version":"11"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u3"},"namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"CVE-2025-27587","versionConstraint":"none (unknown)"}}],"artifact":{"id":"8170614b75c9eae6","name":"openssl","version":"1.1.1n-0+deb11u3","type":"deb","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","layerID":"sha256:b626401ef603dd383fc3a43cf474186827db1875591bfc84b178177ca010015b","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/status","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}},{"path":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","layerID":"sha256:03127cdb479b0f1eb8a9b0df8e8d72ead24979728d3c84ff645611b9d8790f94","accessPath":"/usr/share/doc/openssl/copyright","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","layerID":"sha256:03127cdb479b0f1eb8a9b0df8e8d72ead24979728d3c84ff645611b9d8790f94","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.conffiles","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","layerID":"sha256:03127cdb479b0f1eb8a9b0df8e8d72ead24979728d3c84ff645611b9d8790f94","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.md5sums","annotations":{"evidence":"supporting"}},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list","layerID":"sha256:03127cdb479b0f1eb8a9b0df8e8d72ead24979728d3c84ff645611b9d8790f94","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.list"},{"path":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst","layerID":"sha256:03127cdb479b0f1eb8a9b0df8e8d72ead24979728d3c84ff645611b9d8790f94","accessPath":"/var/lib/dpkg/info/openssl.postinst"}],"language":"","licenses":["OpenSSL"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1n-0\\+deb11u3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:deb/debian/openssl@1.1.1n-0%2Bdeb11u3?arch=amd64&distro=debian-11","upstreams":[]}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2022-42919","dataSource":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2022-42919","namespace":"debian:distro:debian:11","severity":"Negligible","urls":[],"description":"Python 3.9.x before 3.9.16 and 3.10.x before 3.10.9 on Linux allows local privilege escalation in a non-default configuration.
