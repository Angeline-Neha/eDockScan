traversal vulnerability in the (1) extract and (2) extractall functions in the tarfile module in Python allows user-assisted remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) sequence in filenames in a TAR archive, a related issue to CVE-2001-1267. (CVE-2007-4559)The email module of Python through 3.11.3 incorrectly parses e-mail addresses that contain a special character. The wrong portion of an RFC2822 header is identified as the value of the addr-spec. In some applications, an attacker can bypass a protection mechanism in which application access is granted only after verifying receipt of e-mail to a specific domain (e.g., only @company.example.com addresses may be used for signup). This occurs in email/_parseaddr.py in recent versions of Python. (CVE-2023-27043)The \"ipaddress\" module contained incorrect information about whether certain IPv4 and IPv6 addresses were designated as \"globally reachable\" or \"private\". This affected the is_private and is_global properties of the ipaddress.IPv4Address, ipaddress.IPv4Network, ipaddress.IPv6Address, and ipaddress.IPv6Network classes, where values wouldn't be returned in accordance with the latest information from the IANA Special-Purpose Address Registries.CPython 3.12.4 and 3.13.0a6 contain updated information from these registries and thus have the intended behavior. (CVE-2024-4032)There is a MEDIUM severity vulnerability affecting CPython.Regular expressions that allowed excessive backtracking during tarfile.TarFile header parsing are vulnerable to ReDoS via specifically-crafted tar archives. (CVE-2024-6232)There is a MEDIUM severity vulnerability affecting CPython.Theemail module didn't properly quote newlines for email headers whenserializing an email message allowing for header injection when an emailis serialized. (CVE-2024-6923)There is a LOW severity vulnerability affecting CPython, specifically the'http.cookies' standard library module.When parsing cookies that contained backslashes for quoted characters inthe cookie value, the parser would use an algorithm with quadraticcomplexity, resulting in excess CPU resources being used while parsing thevalue. (CVE-2024-7592)There is a severity vulnerability affecting the CPython \"zipfile\"module.When iterating over names of entries in a zip archive (for example, methodsof \"zipfile.ZipFile\" like \"namelist()\", \"iterdir()\", \"extractall()\", etc)the process can be put into an infinite loop with a maliciously craftedzip archive. This defect applies when reading only metadata or extractingthe contents of the zip archive. Programs that are not handlinguser-controlled zip archives are not affected.

cache either needs to have been populated manually or there needs tohave been previous HTTPS accesses done as the cache needs to have entries forthe domains involved to trigger this problem.)When `x.example.com` responds with `Strict-Transport-Security:` headers, thisbug can make the subdomain's expiry timeout *bleed over* and get set for theparent domain `example.com` in curl's HSTS cache.The result of a triggered bug is that HTTP accesses to `example.com` getconverted to HTTPS for a different period of time than what was asked for bythe origin server. If `example.com` for example stops supporting HTTPS at itsexpiry time, curl might then fail to access `http://example.com` until the(wrongly set) timeout expires. This bug can also expire the parent's entry*earlier*, thus making curl inadvertently switch back to insecure HTTP earlierthan otherwise intended.

When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations.

Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations.","cvss":[{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","metrics":{"baseScore":4.4,"exploitabilityScore":0.8,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37891","epss":0.00142,"percentile":0.35049,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-37891","cwe":"CWE-669","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"amazonlinux","version":"2023"},"package":{"name":"python3-pip-wheel","version":"0:21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.7"},"namespace":"amazon:distro:amazonlinux:2023"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"ALAS2023-2024-730","versionConstraint":"< 21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.8 (rpm)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.8"}},{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"amazonlinux","version":"2023"},"package":{"name":"python-pip","version":"21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.7"},"namespace":"amazon:distro:amazonlinux:2023"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"ALAS2023-2024-730","versionConstraint":"< 21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.8 (rpm)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.8"}}],"artifact":{"id":"94b4105d5eb1a2c4","name":"python3-pip-wheel","version":"21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.7","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","layerID":"sha256:9cac7b7902b83b240249c4fde2b23c2d0667b36cc9bc9e2b644b5066e1e07a78","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["MIT and Python and ASL 2.0 and BSD and ISC and LGPLv2 and MPLv2.0 and (ASL 2.0 or BSD)"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:python3-pip-wheel:python3-pip-wheel:21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3-pip-wheel:python3_pip_wheel:21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3_pip_wheel:python3-pip-wheel:21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3_pip_wheel:python3_pip_wheel:21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:amazonlinux:python3-pip-wheel:21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:amazonlinux:python3_pip_wheel:21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3-pip:python3-pip-wheel:21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3-pip:python3_pip_wheel:21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3_pip:python3-pip-wheel:21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3_pip:python3_pip_wheel:21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3:python3-pip-wheel:21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:python3:python3_pip_wheel:21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/amzn/python3-pip-wheel@21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.7?arch=noarch&distro=amzn-2023&upstream=python-pip-21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.7.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"python-pip","version":"21.3.1-2.amzn2023.0.7"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":null,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"ALAS2023-2025-971","dataSource":"https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2023/ALAS2023-2025-971.html","namespace":"amazon:distro:amazonlinux:2023","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"SQLite through 3.40.0, when relying on --safe for execution of an untrusted CLI script, does not properly implement the azProhibitedFunctions protection mechanism, and instead allows UDF functions such as WRITEFILE.

To be able to measure this leak, the attacker\nprocess must either be located in the same physical computer or must\nhave a very fast network connection with low latency. For that reason\nthe severity of this vulnerability is Low.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.4, 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are affected by this issue.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L","metrics":{"baseScore":4.1,"exploitabilityScore":0.7,"impactScore":3.4},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-13176","epss":0.00115,"percentile":0.30862,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-13176","cwe":"CWE-385","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"amazonlinux","version":"2023"},"package":{"name":"openssl-libs","version":"1:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10"},"namespace":"amazon:distro:amazonlinux:2023"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"ALAS2023-2025-882","versionConstraint":"< 3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.19 (rpm)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.19"}},{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"amazonlinux","version":"2023"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10"},"namespace":"amazon:distro:amazonlinux:2023"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"ALAS2023-2025-882","versionConstraint":"< 3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.19 (rpm)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.19"}}],"artifact":{"id":"16d55208793f38b4","name":"openssl-libs","version":"1:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","layerID":"sha256:9cac7b7902b83b240249c4fde2b23c2d0667b36cc9bc9e2b644b5066e1e07a78","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["ASL 2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl-libs:openssl-libs:1\\:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl-libs:openssl_libs:1\\:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl_libs:openssl-libs:1\\:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl_libs:openssl_libs:1\\:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:amazonlinux:openssl-libs:1\\:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:amazonlinux:openssl_libs:1\\:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl-libs:1\\:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl_libs:1\\:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/amzn/openssl-libs@3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10?arch=x86_64&distro=amzn-2023&epoch=1&upstream=openssl-3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl","version":"3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":1,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"GHSA-prj3-ccx8-p6x4","dataSource":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-prj3-ccx8-p6x4","namespace":"github:language:java","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"Netty affected by MadeYouReset HTTP/2 DDoS vulnerability","cvss":[{"type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-55163","epss":0.00076,"percentile":0.23311,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-55163","cwe":"CWE-770","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary"}],"fix":{"versions":["4.1.124.Final"],"state":"fixed","available":[{"version":"4.1.124.Final","date":"2025-08-14","kind":"first-observed"}]},"advisories":[],"risk":0.056999999999999995},"relatedVulnerabilities":[{"id":"CVE-2025-55163","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-55163","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://github.com/netty/netty/security/advisories/GHSA-prj3-ccx8-p6x4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/08/16/1","https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/767506"],"description":"Netty is an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework.

Where the key or parameters that are being checkedhave been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial ofService.The functions EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check() performvarious checks on DSA parameters. Some of those computations take a long timeif the modulus (`p` parameter) is too large.Trying to use a very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not allow usingpublic keys with a modulus which is over 10,000 bits in length for signatureverification. However the key and parameter check functions do not limitthe modulus size when performing the checks.An application that calls EVP_PKEY_param_check() or EVP_PKEY_public_check()and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted source could bevulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.These functions are not called by OpenSSL itself on untrusted DSA keys soonly applications that directly call these functions may be vulnerable.Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey and pkeyparam command line applicationswhen using the `-check` option.The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue.The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue. (CVE-2024-4603)openssl: Use After Free with SSL_free_buffers (CVE-2024-4741)Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with anempty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents tobe sent to the peer.Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequencessuch as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issuecould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sentto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applicationsthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list ofsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally neverbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur byaccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the callingapplication.The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLSapplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised andis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly morewidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list ofprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returnsthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in theclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns thefirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlapbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto iscalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition andreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reportsthat there was no overlap in the lists).This function is typically called from a server side application callback forALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the listof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero inlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should nevernormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if theSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the listsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then theapplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application hasaccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and hasaccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_lenparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then itwill be vulnerable to this problem.In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically selecta protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocolin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comesfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with aclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead.

In particular this issue\ncould result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent\nto the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications\nthat directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of\nsupported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never\nbe a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by\naccident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling\napplication.\n\nThe OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS\napplications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN\n(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and\nis deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more\nwidely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of\nprotocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns\nthe first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the\nclient list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the\nfirst item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap\nbetween the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is\ncalled with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and\nreturns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports\nthat there was no overlap in the lists).\n\nThis function is typically called from a server side application callback for\nALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list\nof protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in\nlength. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never\nnormally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the\nSSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list\nsupplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the\napplication will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has\naccidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has\naccidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len\nparameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a \"no overlap\"\nresponse (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it\nwill be vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIn the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select\na protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol\nin the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes\nfrom the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.\nHowever if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a\nclient_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the\napplication uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of\nconfidentiality will occur.\n\nThis issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most\nlikely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not\nwidely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.\nFinally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active\nexploitation unlikely.\n\nThe FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.\n\nDue to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of\nOpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they\nbecome available.","cvss":[{"source":"134c704f-9b21-4f2e-91b3-4a467353bcc0","type":"Secondary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":9.1,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":5.2},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","epss":0.05822,"percentile":0.90122,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2024-5535","cwe":"CWE-125","source":"openssl-security@openssl.org","type":"Secondary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"amazonlinux","version":"2023"},"package":{"name":"openssl-libs","version":"1:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10"},"namespace":"amazon:distro:amazonlinux:2023"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"ALAS2023-2024-677","versionConstraint":"< 3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.14 (rpm)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.14"}},{"type":"exact-indirect-match","matcher":"rpm-matcher","searchedBy":{"distro":{"type":"amazonlinux","version":"2023"},"package":{"name":"openssl","version":"3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10"},"namespace":"amazon:distro:amazonlinux:2023"},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"ALAS2023-2024-677","versionConstraint":"< 3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.14 (rpm)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.14"}}],"artifact":{"id":"16d55208793f38b4","name":"openssl-libs","version":"1:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10","type":"rpm","locations":[{"path":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","layerID":"sha256:9cac7b7902b83b240249c4fde2b23c2d0667b36cc9bc9e2b644b5066e1e07a78","accessPath":"/var/lib/rpm/rpmdb.sqlite","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"","licenses":["ASL 2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:openssl-libs:openssl-libs:1\\:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl-libs:openssl_libs:1\\:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl_libs:openssl-libs:1\\:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl_libs:openssl_libs:1\\:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:amazonlinux:openssl-libs:1\\:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:amazonlinux:openssl_libs:1\\:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl-libs:1\\:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openssl:openssl_libs:1\\:3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:rpm/amzn/openssl-libs@3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10?arch=x86_64&distro=amzn-2023&epoch=1&upstream=openssl-3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10.src.rpm","upstreams":[{"name":"openssl","version":"3.0.8-1.amzn2023.0.10"}],"metadataType":"RpmMetadata","metadata":{"epoch":1,"modularityLabel":""}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"CVE-2025-53066","dataSource":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-53066","namespace":"nvd:cpe","severity":"High","urls":["https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2025.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/10/msg00026.html"],"description":"Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM for JDK, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: JAXP).

Apache Kafka Clients accept configuration data for setting the SASL/OAUTHBEARER connection with the brokers, including \"sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url\" and \"sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url\". Apache Kafka allows clients to read an arbitrary file and return the content in the error log, or sending requests to an unintended location. In applications where Apache Kafka Clients configurations can be specified by an untrusted party, attackers may use the \"sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url\" and \"sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url\" configuratin to read arbitrary contents of the disk and environment variables or make requests to an unintended location. In particular, this flaw may be used in Apache Kafka Connect to escalate from REST API access to filesystem/environment/URL access, which may be undesirable in certain environments, including SaaS products. \n\nSince Apache Kafka 3.9.1/4.0.0, we have added a system property (\"-Dorg.apache.kafka.sasl.oauthbearer.allowed.urls\") to set the allowed urls in SASL JAAS configuration. In 3.9.1, it accepts all urls by default for backward compatibility.

This is fixed in versions 4.1.125.Final of netty-codec and 4.2.5.Final of netty-codec-compression.","cvss":[{"source":"nvd@nist.gov","type":"Primary","version":"3.1","vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","metrics":{"baseScore":7.5,"exploitabilityScore":3.9,"impactScore":3.6},"vendorMetadata":{}},{"source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Secondary","version":"4.0","vector":"CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N/E:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MAT:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MVC:X/MVI:X/MVA:X/MSC:X/MSI:X/MSA:X/S:X/AU:X/R:X/V:X/RE:X/U:X","metrics":{"baseScore":6.9},"vendorMetadata":{}}],"epss":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-58057","epss":0.00034,"percentile":0.09254,"date":"2025-11-13"}],"cwes":[{"cve":"CVE-2025-58057","cwe":"CWE-409","source":"security-advisories@github.com","type":"Primary"}]}],"matchDetails":[{"type":"exact-direct-match","matcher":"java-matcher","searchedBy":{"language":"java","namespace":"github:language:java","package":{"name":"io.netty:netty-codec","version":"4.1.100.Final"}},"found":{"vulnerabilityID":"GHSA-3p8m-j85q-pgmj","versionConstraint":"<4.1.125.Final (unknown)"},"fix":{"suggestedVersion":"4.1.125.Final"}}],"artifact":{"id":"44c4c17d30c1d734","name":"netty-codec","version":"4.1.100.Final","type":"java-archive","locations":[{"path":"/usr/share/opensearch/performance-analyzer-rca/lib/netty-codec-4.1.100.Final.jar","layerID":"sha256:047d466b11f9b8de82e4d74f4a710a0cf1b43ee9de3cfbb55d1bb0786d3dbed9","accessPath":"/usr/share/opensearch/performance-analyzer-rca/lib/netty-codec-4.1.100.Final.jar","annotations":{"evidence":"primary"}}],"language":"java","licenses":["https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0"],"cpes":["cpe:2.3:a:io.netty.codec:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty.codec:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-project:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-project:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_project:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_project:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-codec:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-codec:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_codec:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_codec:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty.codec:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-project:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_project:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:codec:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:codec:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty-codec:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty:netty-codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty:netty_codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty_codec:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:io.netty:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:codec:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netty:codec:4.1.100.Final:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"],"purl":"pkg:maven/io.netty/netty-codec@4.1.100.Final","upstreams":[],"metadataType":"JavaMetadata","metadata":{"virtualPath":"/usr/share/opensearch/performance-analyzer-rca/lib/netty-codec-4.1.100.Final.jar","pomArtifactID":"netty-codec","pomGroupID":"io.netty","manifestName":"","archiveDigests":[{"algorithm":"sha1","value":"9c3c71e7cf3b8ce3bfc9fa52a524b9ca7ddf259c"}]}}},{"vulnerability":{"id":"ALAS2023-2024-742","dataSource":"https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2023/ALAS2023-2024-742.html","namespace":"amazon:distro:amazonlinux:2023","severity":"High","urls":[],"description":"execute_filter_audio in archive_read_support_format_rar.c in libarchive before 3.7.5 allows out-of-bounds access via a crafted archive file because src can move beyond dst.

The impacted fields are “atime”, “ctime”, “mtime” and “LIBARCHIVE.creationtime”. No input validation is performed prior to the parsing of header values.\n\nParsing of these numbers uses the BigDecimal [3] class from the JDK which has a publicly known algorithmic complexity issue when doing operations on large numbers, causing denial of service (see issue # JDK-6560193 [4]). A third party can manipulate file time headers in a TAR file by placing a number with a very long fraction (300,000 digits) or a number with exponent notation (such as “9e9999999”) within a file modification time header, and the parsing of files with these headers will take hours instead of seconds, leading to a denial of service via exhaustion of CPU resources. This issue is similar to CVE-2012-2098 [5].\n\n[1]:  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COMPRESS-612 \n[2]:  https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/pax.html#tag_20_92_13_05 \n[3]:  https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/BigDecimal.html \n[4]:  https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-6560193 \n[5]:  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2012-2098 \n\nOnly applications using CompressorStreamFactory class (with auto-detection of file types), TarArchiveInputStream and TarFile classes to parse TAR files are impacted.
